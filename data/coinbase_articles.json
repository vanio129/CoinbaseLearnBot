    "text": "The world\u2019s first widely-adopted cryptocurrency. With Bitcoin, people can securely and directly send each other digital money on the internet.\nBitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonymous person or team who outlined the technology in a 2008 white paper. It\u2019s an appealingly simple concept: bitcoin is digital money that allows for secure peer-to-peer transactions on the internet.\nUnlike services like Venmo and PayPal, which rely on the traditional financial system for permission to transfer money and on existing debit/credit accounts, bitcoin is decentralized: any two people, anywhere in the world, can send bitcoin to each other without the involvement of a bank, government, or other institution.\nEvery transaction involving Bitcoin is tracked on the blockchain, which is similar to a bank\u2019s ledger, or log of customers\u2019 funds going in and out of the bank. In simple terms, it\u2019s a record of every transaction ever made using bitcoin.\nUnlike a bank\u2019s ledger, the Bitcoin blockchain is distributed across the entire network. No company, country, or third party is in control of it; and anyone can become part of that network.\nThere will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. This is digital money that cannot be inflated or manipulated in any way.\nIt isn\u2019t necessary to buy an entire bitcoin: you can buy just a fraction of one if that\u2019s all you want or need.\nKey Questions\nWhat is BTC?\nBTC is the abbreviation for bitcoin.\nIs Bitcoin cryptocurrency?\nYes, bitcoin is the first widely adopted cryptocurrency, which is just another way of saying digital money.\nIs there a simple bitcoin definition?\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency used for encrypted, peer-to-peer transactions without needing a central bank\nWhat's the price of bitcoin?\nThe current price of Bitcoin can be found on Coinbase's website.\nIs Bitcoin an investment opportunity?\nLike any other asset, you can make money by buying BTC low and selling high, or lose money in the inverse scenario.\nAt what price did Bitcoin start?\nOne BTC was valued at a fraction of a U.S. penny in early 2010. During the first quarter of 2011, it exceeded a dollar. In late 2017, its value skyrocketed, topping out at close to $20,000, and Bitcoin ended up topping $64,899 in November 2021. You can track the price of bitcoin here.\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency used for encrypted, peer-to-peer transactions without needing a central bank\nWhat Is Bitcoin? by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Buy your first Bitcoin Start with as little as $25 Get started\nSince Bitcoin\u2019s creation, thousands of new cryptocurrencies have been launched, but bitcoin (abbreviated as BTC) remains the largest by market capitalization and trading volume.\nDepending on your goals, bitcoin can function as\n- an investment vehicle\n- a store of value similar to gold\n- a way to transfer value around the world\n- even just a way to explore an emerging technology\nBitcoin is a currency native to the Internet. Unlike government-issued currencies such as the dollar or euro, Bitcoin allows online transfers without a middleman such as a bank or payment processor. The removal of those gatekeepers creates a whole range of new possibilities, including the potential for money to move around the global internet more quickly and cheaply, and allowing individuals to have maximum control over their own assets.\nBitcoin is legal to use, hold, and trade, and can be spent on everything from travel to charitable donations. It\u2019s accepted as payment by businesses including Microsoft and Expedia.\nIs bitcoin money? It\u2019s been used as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account\u2014which are all properties of money. Meanwhile, it only exists digitally; there is no physical version of it.\nTo really grasp how bitcoin works, it helps to start at the beginning. The question of who created bitcoin is a fascinating one, because a decade after inventing the technology\u2014and despite a lot of digging by journalists and members of the crypto community\u2014its creator remains anonymous.\nThe principles behind Bitcoin first appeared in a white paper published online in late 2008 by a person or group going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto.\nThis paper wasn\u2019t the first idea for digital money drawing on the fields of cryptography and computer science\u2014in fact, the paper referred to earlier concepts\u2014but it was a uniquely elegant solution to the problem of establishing trust between different online entities, where people may be hidden (like bitcoin\u2019s own creator) by pseudonyms, or physically located on the other side of the planet.\nNakamoto devised a pair of intertwined concepts: the bitcoin private key and the blockchain ledger. When you hold bitcoin, you control it through a private key\u2014a string of randomized numbers and letters that unlocks a virtual vault containing your purchase. Each private key is tracked on the virtual ledger called the blockchain.\nWhen Bitcoin first appeared, it marked a major advance in computer science, because it solved a fundamental problem of commerce on the internet: how do you transfer value between two people without a trusted intermediary (like a bank) in the middle? By solving that problem, the invention of bitcoin has wide-ranging ramifications: As a currency designed for the internet, it allows for financial transactions that range across borders and around the globe without the involvement of banks, credit-card companies, lenders, or even governments. When any two people\u2014wherever they might live\u2014can send payments to each other without encountering those gatekeepers, it creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative. That, in a nutshell, is bitcoin explained.\nBitcoin creates the potential for an open financial system that is more efficient, more free, and more innovative.\nUnlike credit card networks like Visa and payment processors like Paypal, bitcoin is not owned by an individual or company. Bitcoin is the world\u2019s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in. Bitcoin was designed to be used on the internet, and doesn\u2019t depend on banks or private companies to process transactions.\nOne of the most important elements of Bitcoin is the blockchain, which tracks who owns what, similar to how a bank tracks assets. What sets the Bitcoin blockchain apart from a bank's ledger is that it is decentralized, meaning anyone can view it and no single entity controls it.\nHere are some details about how it all works:\nSpecialized computers known as \u2018mining rigs\u2019 perform the equations required to verify and record a new transaction. In the early days, a typical desktop PC was powerful enough to participate, which allowed pretty much anyone who was curious to try their hand at mining. These days the computers required are massive, specialized, and often owned by businesses or large numbers of individuals pooling their resources. (In October 2019, it required 12 trillion times more computing power to mine one bitcoin than it did when Nakamoto mined the first blocks in January 2009.)\nThe miners\u2019 collective computing power is used to ensure the accuracy of the ever-growing ledger. Bitcoin is inextricably tied to the blockchain; each new bitcoin is recorded on it, as is each subsequent transaction with all existing coins.\nHow does the network motivate miners to participate in the constant, essential work of maintaining the blockchain\u2014verifying transactions? The Bitcoin network holds a continuous lottery in which all the mining rigs around the world race to be the first to solve a math problem. Every 10 min or so, a winner is found, and the winner updates the Bitcoin ledger with new valid transactions. The prize changes over time, but in May 2020, the reward for each winner of this raffle went from 12.5 bitcoin per block to 6.25, and in 2024, with the halving, this reward further dropped from 6.25 to 3.125 as a mechanism to increase scarcity.\nAt the beginning, a bitcoin was technically worthless. At the end of 2019, it was trading at around $7,500, and in November 2021, it topped $64,000. As bitcoin\u2019s value has risen, its easy divisibility (the ability to buy a small fraction of one bitcoin) has become a key attribute. One bitcoin is currently divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin); the bitcoin community refers to the smallest unit as a \u2018Satoshi.\u2019\nNakamoto set the network up so that the number of bitcoin will never exceed 21 million, ensuring scarcity. As of December 2023, there were around 1,4 million bitcoins still available to be mined. The last blocks will theoretically be mined in 2140.\nCryptocurrencies and traditional currencies share some traits \u2014 like how you can use them to buy things or how you can transfer them electronically \u2014 but they\u2019re also different in interesting ways. Here are a few highlights.\nBitcoin is the world\u2019s first completely open payment network which anyone with an internet connection can participate in.\nKey question\nHow does bitcoin have value?\nEssentially the same way a traditional currency does \u2013 because it\u2019s proven itself to be a viable and convenient way to store value, which means it can easily be traded for goods, services, or other assets. It\u2019s scarce, secure, portable (compared to, say, gold), and easily divisible, allowing transactions of all sizes.\nThe easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Coinbase. Coinbase makes it easy to buy, sell, send, receive, and store bitcoin without needing to hold it yourself using something called public and private keys.\nHow to buy bitcoin, with Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong\nHowever, if you choose to buy and store bitcoin outside of an online exchange, here\u2019s how that works.\nEach person who joins the bitcoin network is issued a public key, which is a long string of letters and numbers that you can think of like an email address, and a private key, which is equivalent to a password.\nWhen you buy bitcoin\u2014or send/receive it\u2014you get a public key, which you can think of as a key that unlocks a virtual vault and gives you access to your money.\nAnyone can send bitcoin to you via your public key, but only the holder of the private key can access the bitcoin in the \u201cvirtual vault\u201d once it\u2019s been sent.\nThere are many ways to store bitcoin both online and off. The simplest solution is a virtual wallet.\nIf you want to transfer money from your wallet to a bank account after selling your bitcoin, the Coinbase app makes it as easy as transferring funds from one bank to another. Similar to conventional bank transfers or ATM withdrawals, exchanges like Coinbase set a daily limit, and it may take between a few days and a week for the transaction to be completed.\nThe easiest way to buy bitcoin is to purchase it through an online exchange like Coinbase.\nKey question\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain?\nAll bitcoin transactions and public keys are recorded on a virtual ledger called the blockchain. The ledger is effectively a chronological list of transactions. This ledger is copied\u2014exactly\u2014across every computer that is connected to the bitcoin network, and it is constantly checked and secured using a vast amount of computing power across the globe. The blockchain concept has turned out to be powerful and adaptable, and there are now a wide variety of non-cryptocurrency-related blockchains that are used for things like supply-chain management. The \u2018Bitcoin Blockchain\u2019 specifically refers to the virtual ledger that records bitcoin transactions and private keys.\nBack in 2013, a bitcoin enthusiast named Laszlo Hanyecz created a message-board post offering 10,000 BTC \u2013 which then was worth around $25 \u2013 to anyone who would deliver two pizzas to his Jacksonville, Florida, home. As the legend goes, those two pizzas, which another bitcoin early-adopter bought from a local Papa John\u2019s, marked the first successful purchase of non-virtual goods using bitcoin. Thankfully it\u2019s a lot easier to use bitcoin these days!\nIt\u2019s simple: Transactions using BTC aren\u2019t that different from those using a credit or debit card, but instead of being asked to enter card info, you\u2019ll simply be entering the payment amount and the vendor\u2019s public key (similar to an email address) via a wallet app. (When transacting in person using smartphones or tablets, often a QR code will pop up to simplify the process \u2013 when you scan the code, your wallet app will automatically enter the pertinent information.)\nIt\u2019s private: One of the benefits of paying with bitcoin is that doing so limits the amount of personal information you need to provide. The only time you need to share your name and address is if you\u2019re purchasing physical goods that need to be shipped.\nIt\u2019s flexible: As to what you should do with your bitcoin, that depends completely on your personal interests. Here are some ideas:\nYou can sell it for cash using an exchange or a Bitcoin ATM.\nYou can spend it online or in brick-and-mortar retailers as you would any other currency by using a Bitcoin debit card.\nYou can hold on to some or all of it as part of your investment and savings strategy.\nYou might choose to that is close to your heart (check out).\nAnd if you have a serious budget and unfulfilled astronaut dreams? Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Galactic happily accepts BTC in exchange for the opportunity to blast off on one of its forthcoming space-tourism missions.\nDue to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions.\nBitcoin is global. You can send it across the planet as easily as you can pay with cash in the physical world. It isn't closed on weekends, doesn\u2019t charge you a fee to access your money, and doesn't impose any arbitrary limits.\nBitcoin is irreversible. Bitcoin is like cash, in the sense that transactions cannot be reversed by the sender. In comparison, credit cards, conventional online payment systems, and banking transactions can be reversed after the payment has been made\u2014sometimes months after the initial transaction\u2014due to the centralized intermediaries that complete the transactions. This creates higher fraud risk for merchants, which can lead to higher fees for using credit cards.\nBitcoin is private. When paying with bitcoin, there are no bank statements, or any need to provide unnecessary personal information to the merchant. Bitcoin transactions don\u2019t contain any identifying information other than the bitcoin addresses and amounts involved.\nBitcoin is secure. Due to the cryptographic nature of the Bitcoin network, bitcoin payments are fundamentally more secure than standard debit/credit card transactions. When making a bitcoin payment, no sensitive information is required to be sent over the internet. There is a very low risk of your financial information being compromised, or having your identity stolen.\nBitcoin is open. Every transaction on the Bitcoin network is published publicly, without exception. This means there's no room for manipulation of transactions (save for a highly unlikely 51% attack scenario) or changing the supply of bitcoin. The software that constitutes the core of Bitcoin is free and open-source so anyone can review the code.\nBitcoin is safe. In more than ten years of existence, the bitcoin network has never been successfully hacked. And because the system is permissionless and open-sourced, countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the network and its security.\nBitcoin is virtually \u2018mined\u2019 by a vast, decentralized (also referred to as \u2018peer-to-peer\u2019) network of computers that are constantly verifying and securing the accuracy of the blockchain. Every single bitcoin transaction is reflected on that ledger, with new information periodically gathered together in a \u201cblock,\u201d which is added to all the blocks that came before.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "From how to buy it and how it works to smart contracts and ETH2, a complete beginner's guide to the second-biggest cryptocurrency\nEthereum is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. It is also a decentralized computing platform that can run a wide variety of applications \u2014 including the entire universe of DeFi.\nEthereum, which launched in 2015, is the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. But unlike Bitcoin, it wasn\u2019t created to be digital money. Instead, Ethereum\u2019s founders set out to build a new kind of global, decentralized computing platform that takes the security and openness of blockchains and extends those attributes to a vast range of applications.  \nEverything from financial tools and games to complex databases are already running on the Ethereum blockchain. And its future potential is only limited by developers\u2019 imaginations. As the nonprofit Ethereum Foundation puts it: \u201cEthereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade just about anything.\u201d\nEthereum has become a popular investment vehicle and store of wealth (and can be used, like Bitcoin, to send or receive value without an intermediary).\nThe Ethereum blockchain allows developers to build and run a huge variety of applications: everything from games and advanced databases to complex decentralized financial instruments \u2014 meaning that they don\u2019t require a bank or any other institution in the middle. \nEthereum-based apps are built using \u201csmart contracts.\u201d Smart contracts, like regular paper contracts, establish the terms of an arrangement between parties. But unlike an old-fashioned contract, smart contracts automatically execute when the terms are met without the need for either participating party to know who is on the other side of the deal \u2014 and without the need for any kind of intermediary. \nEthereum, like Bitcoin, is an open source project that is not owned or operated by a single individual. Anyone with an internet connection can run an Ethereum node or interact with the network.\nMuch like Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized blockchain allows any two strangers, anywhere in the world, to send or receive money without a bank in the middle, smart contracts running on Ethereum\u2019s decentralized blockchain allow developers to build complex applications that should run exactly as programmed without downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party interference. \nPopular Ethereum-based innovations include stablecoins, decentralized finance apps (collectively known as DeFi), and other decentralized apps (or dapps).\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Ethereum, Ether, and ETH?\nEthereum is the name of the network. \u201cEther\u201d is the native cryptocurrency token used by the Ethereum network. That said, in day-to-day usage most people call the token \u201cETH\u201d (or just \u201cEthereum\u201d). As a way of sending, receiving, or storing value ETH works much like Bitcoin. But it also has a special role on the Ethereum network. Because users pay fees in ETH to execute smart contracts, you can think of it as the fuel that keeps the whole thing running (which is why those fees are called \u201cgas\u201d).\nIf Bitcoin is \u201cdigital gold,\u201d ETH can be seen as \u201cdigital oil.\u201d\nETH is currently secured by the Ethereum blockchain using a technology called \u201cproof of stake\u201d (more on this below).\nThe fundamental ideas behind cryptocurrencies help make them safe: the systems are permissionless and the core software is open-source, meaning countless computer scientists and cryptographers have been able to examine all aspects of the networks and their security. \nApps running on the Ethereum blockchain, however, are only guaranteed to be as secure as their developers have made them. For example, code can sometimes contain bugs that could result in loss of funds. While their source code is also visible to all, the user bases of each individual app are much smaller than Ethereum\u2019s as a whole, and so fewer eyes are on them. It\u2019s important to do research on any decentralized app you plan to use. \nYou might have heard that the Bitcoin blockchain is a lot like a bank\u2019s ledger, or even a checkbook. It\u2019s a running tally of every transaction made on the network going back to the very beginning \u2014 and the entire network works together to ensure that the tally is accurate and secure.\nThe Ethereum blockchain, on the other hand, is more like a computer: While it also does the work of documenting and securing transactions, it\u2019s much more flexible than the Bitcoin blockchain. Developers can use the Ethereum blockchain to build a huge variety of tools \u2014 everything from logistics management software to games to the entire universe of DeFi applications (which span lending, borrowing, trading, and more).\nEthereum uses a 'virtual machine' to achieve all this, which is like a giant, global computer made up of many individual computers running the Ethereum software. Keeping all of those computers running involves investment in both hardware and electricity by participants. To cover those costs, the network uses its own Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency called Ether (or, more commonly, ETH).\nETH keeps the whole thing running. You interact with the Ethereum network by using ETH to pay the network to execute smart contracts. As a result, the fees paid in ETH are called \u201cgas.\u201d\nGas rates vary depending on how busy the network is. A new version of the Ethereum blockchain called Ethereum 2.0, which aims to increase efficiency, was implemented in September 2022.\nEthereum 2.0 (often referred to as ETH2) is a major upgrade to the Ethereum network. It\u2019s been designed to allow the Ethereum network to grow while increasing security, speed, and efficiency, and was implemented in September 2022, merging the original blockchain with the ETH2 blockchain.\nWhy is Ethereum 2.0 necessary? Moving a popular cryptoasset to a new platform is a complex endeavor, but for Ethereum to scale and evolve, it needed to happen. That\u2019s because the \u201cProof of Work\u201d method used by the ETH 1.0 blockchain to verify transactions caused bottlenecks, increased fees, and consumed substantial resources (particularly electricity).\nWhat is Proof of Work?  How do cryptocurrency networks make sure that nobody spends the same money twice without a central authority like Visa or Paypal in the middle? They use a consensus mechanism. When ETH 1.0 launched, it adopted the consensus mechanism pioneered by Bitcoin: the aptly named Proof of Work. \nProof of Work requires a huge amount of processing power, which is contributed by virtual \u201cminers\u201d around the world who compete to be the first to solve a time-consuming math puzzle. \nThe winner gets to update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions, and is rewarded with a predetermined amount of ETH.  \nThis process happens every 30 seconds (compared to Bitcoin\u2019s approximately 10-minute cadence). As traffic on the network has increased, the limitations of Proof of Work have caused bottlenecks during which fees spike unpredictably.\nEthereum\u2019s founders were aware of Proof of Work\u2019s limitations. So a very different solution was devised for Ethereum 2.0. \u2014 one that will ultimately allow the network to efficiently process thousands of Ethereum transactions a second.\nEthereum 2.0 uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake, which is faster, less resource-intensive, and (at least theoretically) more secure. The end result is similar to Proof of Work\u2019s, in that a network participant is chosen to verify the latest transactions, update the blockchain, and earn some ETH. \nRather than requiring a network of miners racing to solve a puzzle, Proof of Stake requires a robust network of participants who are literally invested in the success of the enterprise.\nThese stakeholders are called validators. Instead of contributing processing power as miners do, validators contribute ETH to a \u201cstaking pool.\u201d \nThe act of contributing ETH to the pool is called staking. If you choose to stake some of your ETH, you will earn rewards in proportion to the size of your stake.  \n The network selects a winner based on the amount of ETH each validator has in the pool and the length of time they\u2019ve had it there \u2014 literally rewarding the most invested participants. \nOnce the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of these attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain. \nAll participating validators receive a reward in ETH, which is distributed by the network in proportion to each validator\u2019s stake. \nSmart contracts 101\nSmart contracts were first proposed in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo. Szabo famously compared a smart contract to a vending machine. Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange.\nHowever you acquire your ETH, you\u2019ll need to understand a few basic concepts. Every address on the Ethereum network is issued a public key and a private key, and you\u2019ll need a wallet to manage your crypto holdings.  \nPublic key: Think of this as the crypto version of an email address. Your Ethereum public key is where people can send you ETH and Ethereum-based tokens like USDC and Dai. You can safely give this out to others.\nPrivate key: Think of this like your password. You should generally avoid giving this out to people. A private key is a long string of letters and numbers. (It can also be in the form of a series of words called a seed phrase.) It\u2019s crucial to keep track of your private keys. If you lose them, you lose your Ether forever. \nWallet: To store and secure your Ether you\u2019ll need a wallet. If you\u2019re just starting out, the easiest option is to make an account via the Coinbase app or coinbase.com \u2014 in which case you\u2019ll interact with a \u201ccustodial wallet\u201d that stores and secures your private keys for you. As you progress you might want to investigate other wallet options that are built for interacting with decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols such as Compound (a lending and savings app) or Uniswap (a decentralized exchange that allows you to trade cryptocurrencies).\nThere are a few ways of thinking about the answer to this question. On one level, Ethereum\u2019s value is set by markets like any other asset. People buy it with Bitcoin, dollars, euros, yen, and other currencies 24 hours a day. Depending on demand, the price can fluctuate from day to day. (Ethereum\u2019s value tends to be volatile compared to currencies such as the US dollar or equities like Fortune 500 stocks because it is still an emerging technology.)\nBut why the market prices it the way it does is a much more complicated question. To many investors Ethereum\u2019s value is based on its flexibility as a platform for issuing stablecoins and running DeFi applications \u2014 resulting in a growing user base and growing transaction fees. \nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "You can dramatically improve your digital security with just a few easy steps\nBy Matt Muller, Head of Security Operations, Coinbase\nAs crypto trading becomes increasingly mainstream, our Security team here at Coinbase has seen cybercriminals getting even more creative and persistent in their attempts to steal assets. While that can sound a little scary at first, the good news is that you can dramatically improve your digital security with just a few easy steps. Not only will this help protect your funds on Coinbase, it can be applied to the rest of your digital life as well!\nWhen someone is able to log into one of your accounts to perform fraudulent activity, this is called an \u201caccount takeover\u201d, or \u201cATO\u201d for short. But how do these fraudsters get into your account in the first place? One common method is called a \u201cSIM-swap.\u201d In a SIM-swap attack, fraudsters will actually contact your wireless carrier pretending to be you, and persuade the customer service agent to redirect your cell service to a different device, by changing the SIM card number associated with your account (hence the name of the attack.) Once they succeed, they are able to receive all calls and SMS messages sent to your phone number \u2014 including any two-factor authentication codes sent to you via SMS. From there, fraudsters will frequently pair those SMS 2FA codes with stolen passwords to try and log into your email account, social media profiles, cloud storage accounts like Dropbox, or financial accounts like Coinbase.\nAt Coinbase, we do a lot of work behind the scenes to detect and try to stop SIM-swap ATOs targeting our customers\u2019 accounts. We also believe that using SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) is better than using no 2FA at all. That said, we encourage everyone to follow the two simple steps below and apply them to all the accounts they care about \u2014 not just their Coinbase accounts.\nYour passwords should be at least 16 characters, extremely complex and unique for your accounts. That\u2019s hard to do by yourself, but password managers like 1Password or Dashlane can be used to create and remember your passwords.\nAre you currently using a password that has been exposed in a third-party data breach somewhere?

    "text": "How is crypto taxed in the U.S.? Your guide to this tax season\nU.S. taxpayers are required to report crypto sales, conversions, payments, and income to the IRS, and state tax authorities where applicable, and each of these transactions has different tax implications. In this article, you'll learn when your crypto is taxed and how your activity might affect your taxes. Let's dive in.\nA quick note before we start\u2026\nCoinbase doesn\u2019t provide tax advice. This article represents our stance on IRS guidance received to date, which may continue to evolve and change. None of this should be considered as advice or an individualized recommendation, but it\u2019s important to us that our customers have relevant information available to them in the most accessible way possible. Please consult a tax professional regarding your own tax circumstances.\nIn the U.S., crypto is considered a digital asset, and the IRS treats it generally like stocks, bonds, and other capital assets. Like these assets, the money you gain from crypto is taxed at different rates, either as capital gains or as income, depending on how you got your crypto and how long you held on to it.\nTo understand if you owe taxes, it\u2019s important to look at how you used your crypto. Transactions that result in a tax are called taxable events. Those that don\u2019t are called non-taxable events. Let\u2019s break them down: \nNot taxable \nBuying crypto with cash and holding it: Just buying and owning crypto isn\u2019t taxable on its own. The tax is often incurred later on when you sell, and its gains are \u201crealized.\u201d \nDonating crypto to a qualified tax-exempt charity or non-profit: If you give crypto directly to a 501(c)(3) charitable organization, like GiveCrypto.org, you may be able to claim a charitable deduction.\nReceiving a gift: If you\u2019re lucky enough to get crypto as a gift, you\u2019re not likely to incur a tax until you sell or participate in another taxable activity like staking.\nGiving a gift: How thoughtful! You can gift up to $18,000 per recipient per year without paying taxes (and higher amounts to spouses) for 2024 and $19,000 per recipient for 2025. If your gift exceeds these limits, you\u2019ll need to file a gift tax return (which generally does not result in any current tax liability). If you transfer crypto to someone else outside of a purchase for goods or services, it may count as a gift, even if you didn\u2019t mean it that way.  \nTransferring crypto to yourself: Transferring crypto between wallets or accounts you own isn\u2019t taxable. You can transfer over your original cost basis and date acquired to continue tracking your potential tax impact for when you eventually sell.\nTaxable as capital gains\nSelling crypto for cash: Did you sell your crypto for U.S. dollars? You\u2019ll owe taxes if you sell your assets for more than you paid for them. If you sell at a loss, you may be able to deduct that loss on your taxes.\nConverting one crypto to another: When you use bitcoin to buy ether, for example, you technically have to sell your bitcoin before you buy a new asset. Because this is a sale, the IRS considers it taxable. You\u2019ll owe taxes if you sold your bitcoin for more than you paid for it.\nSpending crypto on goods and services: If you use bitcoin to buy a pizza, for example, you\u2019ll likely owe taxes on the transaction. To the IRS, spending crypto isn\u2019t that much different from selling it. You need to sell the asset before it can be exchanged for a good or service, and selling crypto makes it subject to capital gains taxes. \nTaxable as income\nGetting paid in crypto: If you were paid in crypto by an employer, your crypto will be taxed as compensation according to your income tax bracket.\nGetting crypto in exchange for goods or services:  If you accept crypto in payment for a good or service, you\u2019re responsible for reporting it as income to the IRS.\nMining crypto: If you mined crypto, you\u2019ll likely owe taxes on your earnings based on the fair market value (often the price) of the mined coins at the time they were received. Crypto mined as a business is taxed as self-employment income.\nEarning staking rewards: Staking rewards are treated like mining proceeds: taxes are based on the fair market value of your rewards on the day you received them. Special note on staked ETH: Income earned on staked ETH will be considered taxable income at the time Coinbase customers are able to unstake (regardless of whether the user chooses to unstake or continue to stake), and therefore gain control over those rewards.\nEarning other income: You might earn rewards by holding certain cryptocurrencies such as USD Coin. This is considered taxable income. Additionally, simply holding cbETH introduces taxable income. \nGetting crypto from a hard fork: Taxes on crypto you got from a hard fork depend on how you use the asset, when it\u2019s available to withdraw from your exchange, and more. See the latest IRS guidance on hard forks\nGetting an airdrop: You might receive airdrops from a crypto company as part of a marketing campaign or giveaway. Getting an airdrop is taxable as income, and you\u2019ll need to report the amount in your taxes. See the latest IRS guidance on airdrops\nReceiving other incentives or rewards: This list isn\u2019t comprehensive \u2014 there are a variety of reasons why you might receive free crypto. These can include rewards from learning rewards or incentives like getting $5 in bitcoin for referring a friend to a crypto exchange. Regardless, you\u2019ll need to report these as income.\nGood news for hodlers\nIf you\u2019re holding crypto, there\u2019s no immediate gain or loss, so the crypto is not taxed. Tax is only incurred when you sell the asset, and you subsequently receive either cash or units of another cryptocurrency: At this point, you have \u201crealized\u201d the gains,  and you have a taxable event. \nSo it looks like some of your crypto activity is taxable \u2014 what now? You can estimate how much you\u2019ll owe in taxes by calculating your income, gains, and losses. Here\u2019s what that means:\nCalculating crypto income\nIf you\u2019re a U.S. taxpayer, you\u2019re probably used to seeing your federal and state income tax deducted from your pay stubs. The crypto you receive as income (like mining, staking, and rewards) is also subject to these same income taxes, which often won't be deducted or withheld. When you report your earnings, you\u2019ll generally owe according to the income tax rate appropriate to your tax bracket. Word of caution: If you\u2019ve earned a lot from crypto activity, it might affect what tax bracket you\u2019re in and you may end up paying a higher tax rate on some of your earnings.\nVisit IRS.gov for the latest guidance on federal income taxes.\nCalculating capital gains and losses\nTo calculate the amount you gained or lost, you\u2019ll first need to know how much crypto you started with. This is called your cost basis.\nKnowing your cost basis\nWhen you buy cryptocurrency, your cost basis is generally determined by how much you paid for it. However, if you received crypto from mining or staking, your cost basis is determined by the fair market value when you received it. Your cost basis for gifted crypto will depend on both the basis the person who transferred it to you had and the fair market value when you received it. \nWhen you sell your crypto, you can subtract your cost basis from your sale price in order to figure out whether you have a capital gain or capital loss. If your proceeds exceed your cost basis, you have a capital gain. If not, you have a capital loss. \nShort-term vs. long-term capital gains\nCapital gains taxes are applied at both the federal and state (where applicable) level. They can be long-term or short-term, and how long you\u2019ve held your crypto affects how much tax you\u2019ll end up owing. If you held onto your crypto for more than a year before selling, you'll generally pay a lower rate than if you sold right away.\nLong-term gains are taxed at a reduced capital gains rate. These rates (0%, 15%, or 20% at the federal level) vary based on your income. Higher income taxpayers may also be subject to the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax on their gains or other income. \nShort-term gains are taxed at your ordinary income rate, which is usually a higher, less-favorable rate.\nRemember, taxable events happen when you realize losses or gains, meaning you\u2019ve sold your crypto by either selling for cash, converting to another crypto, or spending it on a good or service. The gains are unrealized if you still own the original shares. \nUnderstanding your capital losses\nYou\u2019ve realized a capital loss when you sold an asset for less than you paid for it. Losses can work to your advantage, though. You can use losses to offset other capital gains (including from non-crypto assets, like stocks) you may have had during the year on a dollar-for-dollar basis, potentially reducing your overall tax bill. \nIf you have more losses than gains or have no gains at all, the maximum amount of losses that you can declare each year to offset other income is $3,000. Any remainder carries over to subsequent years until the full amount of the loss is applied. \nCoinbase Gain/Loss Report\nCoinbase customers will be able to generate a Gain/Loss Report that details capital gains or losses using the cost basis specification strategy in their tax center settings: customers can choose between a HIFO (highest in, first out), LIFO (last in, first out), and FIFO (first in, first out). The report will only have information about activity on Coinbase. It won\u2019t have information about crypto-related transactions outside of Coinbase. It\u2019s important to review and verify the information for accuracy before you use it to file. The tool should not be used as official tax documentation.

    "text": "A crypto airdrop is a strategy used by blockchain startups to distribute tokens or coins to specific wallet addresses.\nAirdrops strive to raise awareness and adoption of new blockchain projects.\nThere are different types of airdrops, and they may require participants to perform certain tasks or hold a certain amount of existing tokens.\nA crypto airdrop is an activity typically performed by blockchain-based startups to help bootstrap a virtual currency project. Its aim is to spread awareness about the cryptocurrency project and to encourage more people to participate in it when it becomes available. Airdrops are generally communicated through the company's official channels and cryptocurrency communities. Coins or tokens are sent only to specific wallets based on the blockchain network or coins held in existing wallets.\nTo qualify for the tokens or coins, a recipient may need to hold a minimum quantity of the crypto coins in their wallet. Alternatively, they may need to perform a certain task, such as discussing the currency on a forum, connecting with a particular member of the blockchain project, or writing a blog post.\nThere are several types of crypto airdrops, each with its own set of requirements and goals.\nStandard Airdrop: Participants interested in receiving an airdrop simply express their interest in order to receive the airdrop. The individual must provide a valid wallet address, and some airdrops require no additional information beyond this.\nBounty Airdrop: Bounty crypto airdrops occur when users perform certain tasks. These tasks often entail raising awareness of a project through various channels.\nHolder Airdrop: This type of airdrop requires participants to hold a certain amount of the existing coins or tokens in their wallets to qualify for the tokens. The amount of tokens received may depend on the amount and duration of holding the existing coins or tokens.\nExclusive Airdrop: This type of airdrop requires participants to be selected or invited by the project team or partners to receive the tokens. The selection criteria may be based on reputation, influence, expertise, contribution, etc.\nA crypto airdrop usually involves the following steps:\nThe project team communicates the details and requirements of the airdrop through their official channels or cryptocurrency communities.\nThe interested participants register for the airdrop by providing their wallet address and other information or performing the required tasks.\nThe project team verifies the eligibility and validity of the participants and distributes the tokens to their wallets according to the rules of the airdrop.\nThe participants receive the tokens in their wallets and can use them according to the terms and conditions of the project.\nCrypto airdrops can be a source of compensation for cryptocurrency enthusiasts who participate in them. There are several ways to receive compensation through crypto airdrops, such as:\nSelling: One way to receive compensation through crypto airdrops is to sell the tokens once they become available. Depending on the demand and supply of the tokens, their value may increase or decrease over time.\nHolding: Another way to receive compensation through crypto airdrops is to hold the tokens for long-term appreciation. If the project behind the tokens is successful and valuable, their value may increase significantly over time.\nDespite their popularity, however, crypto airdrops aren\u2019t always as risk-free as they seem. Because recipients receive tokens or coins in their wallets, there will be airdrops that are nothing more than pump-and-dump schemes. More specifically, the creator issues a token and hopes there will be enough hype surrounding it to have it listed on an exchange. Once tokens begin trading, the creator sells their sizeable portion of tokens, crashing the price. Therefore, it's crucial to do your due diligence before participating in a crypto airdrop.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "TL;DR: Ethereum Layer-2 blockchains are solutions designed to enhance the scalability of the Ethereum network. They operate on top of the Ethereum blockchain (Layer-1), inheriting its security while striving to provide faster and less costly transactions. Common types of Layer-2 solutions include rollups and sidechains.\nEthereum, conceptualized by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, is a decentralized network that maintains a shared database capable of executing smart contracts. These self-executing agreements have paved the way for decentralized applications (dApps), resulting in increased use of Ethereum. However, this growth has also highlighted scalability issues, such as high transaction fees, network congestion, and slow transaction times during periods of high network activity.\nLayer-2 refers to any off-chain network, system, or technology built on top of a blockchain (commonly known as a Layer-1 network) that strives to extend the capabilities of the underlying base layer network. Layer-2 solutions inherit the security of the blockchain they are built on top of, with transaction data verified and confirmed by the underlying blockchain network. They strive to increase transaction throughput, with the intention of reducing fees, without compromising on decentralization or security.\nThe blockchain scalability trilemma posits that blockchains are incapable of scaling effectively while keeping the underlying network both secure and decentralized. Instead, there must be tradeoffs between these three features. Layer-2 solutions are built on the premise that this scalability limitation exists because blockchains are tasked with too many things. By sharing the burden of transaction processing, Layer-2 solutions are designed to address these scalability issues.\nCommon types of Layer-2 solutions on Ethereum include optimistic rollups and Zero-Knowledge rollups (ZK rollups). Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups are considered secure, as they inherit the Ethereum mainnet\u2019s security. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility of optimistic rollups makes it convenient for developers to migrate existing smart contracts from Ethereum to optimistic rollup blockchains. Zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines (zkEVMs) can provide the scalability benefits of both zero-knowledge proofs and EVM compatibility.\nLayer-2 solutions are considered a component in the future scalability of Ethereum. By providing a faster, less costly route for executing Ethereum transactions, they are designed to address the current issues of high transaction fees and network congestion. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, the role of Layer-2 solutions may become more prominent.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

This broad definition encompasses a wide range of items, from photos, documents, and videos to more complex forms such as cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets.\nDigital assets have become increasingly important as technology integrates more into our personal and professional lives. They can be assigned a value\u2014monetary or intangible. Some digital items might only be valuable to the creator or one person, such as a family picture on your phone taken at a gathering. Others could be valuable to a much wider audience.\nDigital assets have evolved into more than just words, pictures, videos, audio, and documents. With the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, the concept of blockchain\u2014a distributed public ledger secured by a consensus mechanism\u2014was brought into the limelight. This technology aims to facilitate the creation of new types of digital assets, such as cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets.\nFor a digital asset to be considered an asset, it must first have the potential to create value in that it can be used in a manner that generates value for the owner. The digital asset should then be able to transfer ownership through acquisition, gifting, or other means of giving the rights to someone else, along with the value the item can bring. It must also be discoverable or stored somewhere that it can be found.\nThere are many different types of digital assets. Traditional forms include photos, documents, videos, books, audio/music, animations, illustrations, manuscripts, emails and email accounts, logos, metadata, content, and gaming accounts.\nNewer digital assets are based on blockchain or similar technologies. These include non-fungible tokens (NFTs), cryptocurrencies, tokens, crypto assets, tokenized assets, security tokens, and central bank digital currencies.\nDigital assets have become an integral part of our lives. We turn to digitally hosted information for learning, store our photos and important documents in digital form, and even use digital assets like cryptocurrencies for transactions. Businesses and governments also store and manage data and information, all of which have different values depending on how they can be used.\nDigital assets have a profound impact on our daily lives. For instance, you might wake up one morning and acquire a sports video token of your favorite running back's winning touchdown. At work, you might use a cryptocurrency to acquire sales data to analyze a specific market and send a digital presentation of your findings to your boss.

It operates 24 hours a day during weekdays, with trading sessions in major financial hubs such as London, New York, Tokyo, and Sydney. Traders make predictions about the strength or weakness of one currency relative to another and base their choices on analysis (fundamental, technical, and sentiment).\nForex trading is known for its notable level of liquidity, meaning there is a substantial amount of trading activity and trading volume. This notable liquidity allows traders to easily enter and exit positions without significantly impacting the market price. However, forex trading also involves the use of leverage, which can boost profits but also raises the possibility of considerable losses. Therefore, risk management is crucial in forex trading.\nCrypto trading involves the trading of digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin on a decentralized platform. Unlike traditional currencies, cryptos are not backed by any government or financial institution and their value is determined solely by supply and demand on the market.\nCrypto trading is known for its potential for notable returns due to the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market. This volatility can present excellent opportunities for considerable gains for savvy traders. The crypto markets never close, offering unmatched accessibility for traders. However, the notable volatility of the cryptocurrency market can also pose a considerable risk, and traders must exercise caution and proper risk management.\nWhile both forex and crypto trading involve trading currencies, there are key differences between the two.\nForex trading involves trading fiat currency pairings and is regulated by financial institutions and governments.

Instead, it is governed by a community that shares a common goal and operates based on a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain. DAOs are internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members. They have built-in treasuries that are only accessible with the approval of their members. Decisions are made via proposals the group votes on during a specified period.\nDAOs operate using smart contracts, which are essentially chunks of code that automatically execute whenever a set of criteria are met. These smart contracts establish the DAO\u2019s rules. Those with a stake in a DAO then get voting rights and may influence how the organization operates by deciding on or creating new governance proposals. This model prevents DAOs from being spammed with proposals: A proposal will only pass once the majority of stakeholders approve it. How that majority is determined varies from DAO to DAO and is specified in the smart contracts.\nThere are several reasons why an entity or collective group of individuals may want to pursue a DAO structure. Some of the potential advantages of this form of management include decentralization. Decisions impacting the organization are made by a collection of individuals as opposed to a central authority. This eliminates the need for third-party facilitators and has the potential to enhance the cryptocurrency space by promoting transparency and autonomy.\nWhile DAOs offer numerous potential benefits, they also come with their own set of challenges. One of the major limitations is security. DAOs must ensure security is prioritized, as exploits can leave a DAO drained of a large amount of its treasury savings. Moreover, the accumulation of voting rights tokens may lead to a concentration of power, which could potentially undermine the decentralized nature of the organization.\nOne of the first DAOs named The DAO was an organization created by developers to automate decisions and facilitate cryptocurrency transactions. However, it was exploited and drained of a large amount of cryptocurrency. Despite this setback, the incident led to notable improvements in the security and operation of subsequent DAOs. Another example is ConstitutionDAO, which was formed in an attempt to acquire a copy of the U.S. Constitution. Though the DAO did not succeed in acquiring the asset, it demonstrated that a collection of like-minded individuals could form and pursue such endeavors.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

On other occasions, they might only be meant as a joke but somehow gain followers and individuals interested in the token. If you find distinguishing between memecoins, scams, and cryptocurrency confusing, you're not alone. It's critical to understand the risks to help you avoid unexpected volatility and losses.\nMemecoins have increased in visibility in recent years. This is largely due to endorsements from high-profile individuals and the role of memecoins in digital culture. Despite their risky nature, memecoins have gained attention from traders due to the possibility of high returns. Engaging with memecoins carries risk and is something you should only attempt armed with research and experience.\nSome countries have taken steps to regulate memecoins. This highlights the importance of understanding the regulatory landscape of memecoins in your respective country before engaging in any trading activities.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "Definition\nNFTs (or \u201cnon-fungible tokens\u201d) are a special kind of cryptoasset in which each token is unique \u2014 as opposed to \u201cfungible\u201d assets like Bitcoin and dollar bills, which are all worth exactly the same amount. Because every NFT is unique, they can be used to authenticate ownership of digital assets like artworks, recordings, and virtual real estate or pets.\nIn February 2021, a 10-second video by an artist named Beeple sold online for $6.6 million. Around the same time, Christie\u2019s announced that it would be selling a collage of 5,000 \u201call-digital\u201d works by the Wisconsin-based artist, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann. It was put on a virtual auction block with a starting price of $100 \u2014 and on March 11 it sold for a staggering $69 million. \nBeyond the high prices, there was one other fact that observers found fascinating. In exchange for their money, collectors who buy Beeples don\u2019t receive any physical manifestation of the artwork. Not even a framed print. What they do get is an increasingly popular kind of cryptoasset called an NFT \u2014 short for non-fungible token. \nEach Beeple piece is paired with a unique NFT \u2014 a token attesting that each owner\u2019s version is the real one. \u201cWe are in a very unknown territory,\u201d Christie\u2019s contemporary art specialist Noah Davis told Reuters. \u201cIn the first 10 minutes of bidding we had more than a hundred bids from 21 bidders and we were at a million dollars.\u201d\nYou can think of NFTs as being kind of like certificates of authenticity for digital artifacts. They\u2019re currently being used to sell a huge range of virtual collectibles, including:\nNBA virtual trading cards \nMusic and video clips from EDM stars like Deadmau5\nVideo art by Grimes\nThe original \u201cnyan cat\u201d meme \nA tweet by Dallas Mavericks owner and entrepreneur Mark Cuban \nVirtual real estate in a place called Decentraland  \nAs Bitcoin and other crypto has boomed in popularity over the last year, NFTs have also soared \u2014 growing to an estimated $338 million in 2020. Each NFT is stored on an open blockchain (often Ethereum\u2019s) and anyone interested can track them as they\u2019re created, sold, and resold. Because they use smart contract technology, NFTs can be set up so that the original artist continues to earn a percentage of all subsequent sales. \nAlong the way, NFTs have raised fascinating philosophical questions about the nature of ownership. Wondering why digital artifacts that can be endlessly copied and pasted have any value at all? Proponents would point out that most kinds of collecting isn\u2019t based on inherent value. Old comic books were produced for pennies\u2019 worth of ink and paper. Rare sneakers are often made out of the same materials as worthless ones. Some paintings hang in the Louvre, others end up in thrift shops. \nAs the collector who sold the $6.6 million Beeple piece noted, you can take a nice picture of the Mona Lisa, but it\u2019s not the Mona Lisa. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have any value because it doesn\u2019t have the provenance or the history of the work,\u201d said the Beeple fan. \u201cThe reality here is that this is very, very valuable because of who is behind it.\u201d\nEvery bitcoin is worth as much as every other bitcoin. NFTs, on the other hand, are all unique. \u201cFungibility\u201d refers to goods or assets that are all the same and can be swapped interchangeably. A dollar bill is another perfect example \u2014 each is worth exactly one dollar. \nConcert tickets, by contrast, are non-fungible. Even if every Radiohead ticket is the same price, they aren\u2019t directly exchangeable. Each represents a specific seat and a specific date \u2014 no other ticket will have those exact characteristics.\nDigital-artwork NFTs are mostly sold on specialized marketplaces like Zora, Rarible, and Opensea. If you\u2019re more interested in games and sports collectibles, developers like Dapper Labs have created experiences including NBA Top Shot (virtual trading cards) and Cryptokitties (a Pokemon-ish digital-cat collecting app that actually was the first NFT hit in late-2017). Online games including Gods Unchained are starting to use NFTs to sell in-game assets like weapons or cosmetic upgrades. Real estate in new virtual worlds is sold via markets including Decentraland and The Sandbox.\nYou can also buy or sell some NFTs directly via a compatible crypto wallet.\nIf you\u2019re interested in DeFi, you might have heard of the ERC-20 standard, which allows anyone to create a token compatible with the Ethereum blockchain. Those are \u201cfungible\u201d tokens. Most non-fungible tokens are built using the ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards, which allow creators to issue unique cryptoassets via smart contract. Because each NFT is stored on a blockchain, there is an immutable record starting with the token\u2019s creation and including every sale. (Some NFT-focused developers have also built their own alternative blockchains, including Dapper Lab\u2019s Flow.)\nGood question! Some people display their digital artworks on large monitors. Some buy virtual real estate (via NFT, of course) in which they\u2019re able to build virtual galleries or museums. You can also roam virtual worlds like Decentraland and check out other people\u2019s collections. For some fans, the appeal is in the buying and selling \u2014 much like any other asset class. (The collector who sold the $6.9 million Beeple paid less than $70,000 for it in October 2020). \nMore and more mainstream artists have also gotten involved in the space \u2014 especially from the world of music. In early March, Nashville band Kings of Leon announced their next album would arrive in the form of multiple NFTs. Depending on which a fan buys, various perks will be unlocked \u2014 like alternate cover art, limited-edition vinyl, and even a \u201cgolden ticket\u201d to a VIP concert experience. \nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "Definition\nA smart contract, like any contract, establishes the terms of an agreement. But unlike a traditional contract, a smart contract\u2019s terms are executed as code running on a blockchain like Ethereum. Smart contracts allow developers to build apps that take advantage of blockchain security, reliability, and accessibility while offering sophisticated peer-to-peer functionality \u2014 everything from loans and insurance to logistics and gaming.\nJust like any contract, smart contracts lay out the terms of an agreement or deal. What makes smart contracts \u201csmart,\u201d however, is that the terms are established and executed as code running on a blockchain, rather than on paper sitting on a lawyer\u2019s desk. Smart contracts expand on the basic idea behind Bitcoin \u2014 sending and receiving money without a \u201ctrusted intermediary\u201d like a bank in the middle \u2014  to make it possible to securely automate and decentralize virtually any kind of deal or transaction, no matter how complex. And because they run on a blockchain like Ethereum, they offer security, reliability, and borderless accessibility.\nSmart contracts allow developers to build a wide variety of decentralized apps and tokens. They\u2019re used in everything from new financial tools to logistics and game experiences, and they\u2019re stored on a blockchain like any other crypto transaction. Once a smart-contract app has been added to the blockchain, it generally can\u2019t be reversed or changed (although there are some exceptions).\nSmart-contract-powered apps are often referred to as \u201cdecentralized applications\u201d or \u201cdapps\u201d \u2013 and they include decentralized finance (or DeFi) tech that aims to transform the banking industry. DeFi apps allow cryptocurrency holders to engage in complex financial transactions \u2014 saving, loans, insurance \u2014 without a bank or other financial institution taking a cut and from anywhere in the world. Some of the more popular current smart-contract powered applications include:\nUniswap: A decentralized exchange that allows users, via smart contract, to trade certain kinds of crypto without any central authority setting the exchange rates.\nCompound: A platform that uses smart contracts to let investors earn interest and borrowers to instantly get a loan without the need for a bank in the middle. \nUSDC: A cryptocurrency that is pegged via smart contract to the US dollar, making one USDC worth one U.S. dollar. UDDC is part of a newer category of digital money known as stablecoins.\nSo how would you use these smart contract-powered tools? Imagine you\u2019re holding some Ethereum that you\u2019d like to trade for USDC. You could put some Ethereum into Uniswap, which, via smart contract, can automatically find you the best exchange rate, make the trade, and send you your USDC. You could then put some of your USDC into Compound to lend to others and receive an algorithmically determined rate of interest \u2014 all without using a bank or other financial institution. \nIn traditional finance, swapping currencies is expensive and time consuming. And it isn't easy or secure for individuals to loan out their liquid assets to strangers on the other side of the world. But smart contracts make both of those scenarios, and a vast variety of others, possible.\nSmart contracts were first proposed in the 1990s by a computer scientist and lawyer named Nick Szabo. Szabo famously compared a smart contract to a vending machine. Imagine a machine that sells cans of soda for a quarter. If you put a dollar into the machine and select a soda, the machine is hardwired to either produce your drink and 75 cents in change, or (if your choice is sold out) to prompt you to make another selection or get your dollar back. This is an example of a simple smart contract. Just like a soda machine can automate a sale without a human intermediary, smart contracts can automate virtually any kind of exchange.\nCurrently, Ethereum is the most popular smart contract platform, but many other cryptocurrency blockchains (including EOS, Neo, Tezos, Tron, Polkadot, and Algorand) can run them. A smart contract can be created and deployed to a blockchain by anyone. Their code is transparent and publicly verifiable, which means that any interested party can see exactly what logic a smart contract follows when it receives digital assets.\nSmart contracts are written in a variety of programming languages (including Solidity, Web Assembly, and Michelson). On the Ethereum network,  each smart contract\u2019s code is stored on the blockchain, allowing any interested party to inspect the contract\u2019s code and current state to verify its functionality. \nEach computer on the network (or \u201cnode\u201d) stores a copy of all existing smart contracts and their current state alongside the blockchain and transaction data. \nWhen a smart contract receives funds from a user, its code is executed by all nodes in the network in order to reach a consensus about the outcome and resulting flow of value. This is what allows smart contracts to securely run without any central authority, even when users are making complex financial transactions with unknown entities.\nTo execute a smart contract on the Ethereum network, you will generally have to pay a fee called \u201cgas\u201d (so named because these fees keep the blockchain running).\nOnce deployed onto a blockchain, smart contracts generally can\u2019t be altered, even by their creator. (There are exceptions to this rule.) This helps ensure that they can\u2019t be censored or shut down. \nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "GameFi, or game finance, is a fusion of online gaming and decentralized finance, creating an in-game economy.\nIt introduces the concept of play-to-earn (P2E), where in-game activity may provide the player with digital assets, rare items, and more.\nBlockchain technology and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aim to give players sole ownership in GameFi, and players may receive digital tokens while playing.\nGameFi, short for gaming finance, is a relatively new concept that combines elements of gaming and decentralized finance. It represents a new category of decentralized applications (dApps) that strives to merge the gaming and blockchain worlds. By creating a gaming ecosystem that utilizes blockchain technology, digital assets, and decentralized finance, GameFi aims to improve player experience and provide opportunities for compensation.\nThe core idea behind GameFi is to provide players with ways to receive token rewards and assets for gaming achievements and skills. GameFi has been the catalyst behind a new subset of gaming experiences commonly referred to as play-to-earn games. These games provide various forms of rewards, including digital tokens and in-game assets such as virtual land, avatars, weapons, and costumes. Each project operates with a unique model and economy. Most commonly, the in-game assets are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that run on the blockchain and can be traded on NFT marketplaces.\nBlockchain technology plays a crucial role in GameFi. It powers the games and the in-game tokens. Smart contracts also play a role, helping to decentralize much of the online gaming experience. Decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and play-to-earn mechanisms contribute to the functionality of GameFi. Blockchain games aim to provide open in-game economies with sovereign ownership over digital items and currencies.\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to GameFi\u2019s emergence. On the positive side, P2E is an alternative to the traditional pay-to-play models of earlier video games. It gives way to more earning opportunities by simply engaging in blockchain games. It could potentially encourage more industry involvement, potentially leading to increased adoption. NFTs are a way to promote virtual asset ownership without control by centralized entities. On the other hand, there are challenges such as the need for a balanced economy and the risk of market volatility.\nGiven the current size of the industry, market forecasts suggest potential growth in the coming years. There is a possibility that the industry could reach over $100B, potentially contributing to the growth of DeFi, NFTs, the metaverse, and more. As the supply and demand for the gaming token scale, the platform may experience network effects. This initiates a self-reinforcing cycle and could be identified as a functional GameFi ecosystem.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "TL;DR\nThe next Bitcoin halving is projected to occur on April 16, 2024 and will lower the mining reward to 3.125 bitcoins per block.\nBitcoin halving occurs approximately every four years and reduces the rate at which new bitcoins are created by 50%.\nThe halving reduces supply of new bitcoins entering the market, which could potentially lead to price appreciation if demand remains constant or increases.\nEven though Bitcoin is digital money, it can't be created endlessly, and verifiable scarcity is core to its value proposition.\nFoundational to the Bitcoin protocol are two concepts relating to scarcity:\nFirst, there is Bitcoin's limited supply. The protocol dictates that the total number of bitcoins that can ever exist is capped at 21 million, and it's impossible for more bitcoins to ever exist. This is contrary to fiat currencies, where more money can be printed at the discretion of the government or central bank, potentially leading to inflation.\nThe second concept is referred to as the halving. Approximately every four years, the Bitcoin mining reward, also known as the \"block reward,\" is halved. This means that the reward given to the contributors securing the network is reduced by 50%, directly impacting the rate at which new Bitcoins are introduced into circulation.\nIn May 2020, the amount of new Bitcoins added to the network (every 10 minutes) via virtual \"mining\" was halved from 12.5 to 6.25. In April 2024, it will drop again to around 3.125 \u2014 and the process will continue until all 21 million coins have been mined (which estimates say should happen around the year 2140).\nAt this point, miners will rely solely on transaction fees to validate blocks.\nBy issuing fewer bitcoins over time, the halving makes it more likely that Bitcoin's value will rise (assuming consistent levels of demand), which is in sharp contrast to fiat currencies, which typically decline in value over time via inflation (this is, for example, why you could get a Coke for a dime in the 1960s).\nIn short, the halving is one of the ways Bitcoin's protocol maintains scarcity, and scarcity is one of the reasons why Bitcoin is sought after by millions of people.\nBut scarcity is not the only reason why Bitcoin halving is important, and there are other elements that make the halving an event closely followed.\nFor example, Bitcoin halving usually attracts more press coverage of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. As the event garners headlines, it naturally piques the interest of potential new investors who might not have previously considered investing in Bitcoin or engaging with cryptocurrencies. This surge in attention can lead to an increase in demand for Bitcoin as new and existing investors aim to capitalize on the potential price movements caused by the halving.\nTo better understand how halving works, we first need to understand exactly what Bitcoin mining is.\nBitcoin uses a proof-of-work (PoW) system to validate transaction information, called this way because solving the encrypted hash takes time and energy, which acts as proof that work was done. In this system, individuals use computers or specialized mining rigs to join the Bitcoin network, acting as both transaction processors and validators.\nOnce a block is filled with transactions, it is closed and sent to a mining queue, where miners race to be the first to solve the block's cryptographic puzzle. When the miners confirm the legitimacy of the transactions in a block, they open a new one and receive a reward for their work.\nThis process creates a chain of blocks containing information, creating what we know as the blockchain.\nWith each halving event, the reward for these network contributors is slashed by half, slowing down the pace at which new bitcoins are introduced into circulation. For context, as of March 2024, more than 19 million bitcoins have been mined, meaning there are approximately 2 million bitcoins left to be virtually \"mined.\"\nAs of March 2024, Bitcoin has already gone through three halvings:\nOn November 28, 2012, the reward dropped from 50 to 25 bitcoins per block.\nThen on July 9, 2016, it went down again from 25 to 12.5 bitcoins per block.\nAnd most recently, on May 11, 2020, it halved from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins per block.\nSince Bitcoin blocks are mined about every 10 minutes, the next halving is projected to occur around the third week of April 2024, lowering the mining reward to 3.125 bitcoins per block.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "The peer-to-peer lending, speedy transactions, and anonymity made possible by DEXs have made them increasingly popular in developing economies \u2014 where solid banking infrastructure might not be available. Anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can trade via a DEX. \nTrickier user interfaces Navigating decentralized exchanges requires some specialized knowledge and the interfaces aren\u2019t always easy \u2014 be prepared to do a lot of research and don\u2019t expect the DEX itself to offer much handholding. You\u2019ll generally have to look offsite for a walk-through or explainer. Caution is required because it\u2019s possible to make an unfixable error, like sending coins to the wrong wallet. Another common issue is known as \u201cimpermanent loss,\u201d which can result from pairing a more volatile cryptocurrency with a less volatile one in a liquidity pool. (The main takeaway here? Do your own research.)\nSmart contract vulnerability Any DeFi protocol is only as secure as the smart contracts that power it \u2014 and code can have exploitable bugs (despite lengthy testing) that can result in the loss of your tokens. And while a smart contract might work as intended under normal circumstances, not all rare events, human factors, and hacks can be anticipated by developers. \nRiskier coins With the unvetted, vast array of tokens available on most DEXs, there are also a greater number of scams and schemes to be wary of.

    "text": "\u201cProof of work\u201d and \u201cproof of stake\u201d are the two major consensus mechanisms cryptocurrencies use to verify new transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new tokens.\nDefinition\n\u201cProof of work\u201d and \u201cproof of stake\u201d are the two major consensus mechanisms cryptocurrencies use to verify new transactions, add them to the blockchain, and create new tokens.  Proof of work, first pioneered by Bitcoin, uses mining to achieve those goals. Proof of stake \u2014 which is employed by Cardano, the ETH2 blockchain, and others \u2014 uses staking to achieve the same things.   \nDecentralized cryptocurrency networks need to make sure that nobody spends the same money twice without a central authority like Visa or PayPal in the middle. To accomplish this, networks use something called a \u201cconsensus mechanism,\u201d which is a system that allows all the computers in a crypto network to agree about which transactions are legitimate. \nThere are two major consensus mechanisms used by most cryptocurrencies today. Proof of work is the older of the two, used by Bitcoin, Ethereum 1.0, and many others. The newer consensus mechanism is called proof of stake, and it powers Ethereum 2.0, Cardano, Tezos and other (generally newer) cryptocurrencies.  To understand proof of stake, it\u2019s helpful to first understand proof of work, so we\u2019ve paired them in this explainer.\nProof of work is the original crypto consensus mechanism, first used by Bitcoin. Proof of work and mining are closely related ideas. The reason it\u2019s called \u201cproof of work\u201d is because the network requires a huge amount of processing power. Proof-of-work blockchains are secured and verified by virtual miners around the world racing to be the first to solve a math puzzle. The winner gets to update the blockchain with the latest verified transactions and is rewarded  by the network with a predetermined amount of crypto. \nProof of work has some powerful advantages, especially for a relatively simple but hugely valuable cryptocurrency like Bitcoin (learn more about how Bitcoin works). It\u2019s a proven, robust way of maintaining a secure decentralized blockchain. As the value of a cryptocurrency grows, more miners are incentivized to join the network, increasing its power and security.  Because of the amount of processing power involved, it becomes impractical for any individual or group to meddle with a valuable cryptocurrency\u2019s blockchain. \nOn the flip side, it\u2019s an energy-intensive process that can have trouble scaling to accommodate the vast number of transactions smart-contract compatible blockchains like Ethereum can generate. And so alternatives have been developed, the most popular of which is called proof of stake.\nEthereum\u2019s developers understood from the beginning that proof of work would present limitations in scalability that would eventually need to be overcome \u2014 and, indeed, as Ethereum-powered decentralized finance (or DeFi) protocols have surged in popularity, the blockchain has struggled to keep up, causing fees to spike. \nWhile the Bitcoin blockchain mostly just has to process incoming and outgoing bitcoin transactions, much like a vast checkbook, Ethereum\u2019s blockchain also has to process a vast array of DeFi transactions, stablecoin smart contracts, NFT minting and sales, and whatever innovations developers come up with in the future. \nTheir solution has been to build an entirely new ETH2 blockchain \u2014 which began rolling out in December 2020 and should be finished in 2022. The upgraded version of Ethereum will employ a faster and less resource intensive consensus mechanism called proof of stake. Cryptocurrencies including Cardano, Tezos, and Atmos all use proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms \u2014 with the goal being to maximize speed and efficiency while lowering fees. \nIn a proof of stake system, staking serves a similar function to proof of work\u2019s mining, in that it\u2019s the process by which a network participant gets selected to add the latest batch of transactions to the blockchain and earn some crypto in exchange. \nThe exact details vary by project, but in general proof of stake blockchains employ a network of \u201cvalidators\u201d who contribute \u2014 or \u201cstake\u201d \u2014 their  own crypto in exchange for a chance of getting to validate new transaction, update the blockchain, and earn a reward. \nThe network selects a winner based on the amount of crypto each validator has in the pool and the length of time they\u2019ve had it there \u2014 literally rewarding the most invested participants. \nOnce the winner has validated the latest block of transactions, other validators can attest that the block is accurate. When a threshold number of attestations have been made, the network updates the blockchain. \nAll participating validators receive a reward in the native cryptocurrency, which is generally distributed by the network in proportion to each validator\u2019s stake. \nBecoming a validator is a major responsibility and requires a fairly high level of technical knowledge. The minimum amount of crypto that validators are required to stake is often relatively high (for ETH2, for example, it\u2019s 32 ETH) and validators can lose some of their stake via a process called slashing if their node goes offline or if they validate a \u201cbad\u201d block of transactions.  \n But even if that sounds like too much responsibility, you can still participate in staking by joining a staking pool run by someone else \u2014 and earn rewards for crypto that would otherwise be sitting around. This process is often referred to as delegating, and tools offered by exchanges by Coinbase can make it simple and seamless.\nEnergy consumption is one major difference between the two consensus mechanisms. Because proof-of-stake blockchains don\u2019t require miners to spend electricity on duplicative processes (competing to solve the same puzzle), proof of stake allows networks to operate with substantially lower resource consumption.\nBoth consensus mechanisms have economic consequences that penalize network disruptions and thwart malicious actors. In proof of work, the penalty for miners submitting invalid information, or blocks, is the sunk cost of computing power, energy, and time. In proof of stake, the validators\u2019 staked crypto funds serve as an economic incentive to act in the network\u2019s best interests. In the case that a validator accepts a bad block, a portion of their staked funds will be \u201cslashed\u201d as a penalty. The amount that a validator can be slashed depends on the network.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nPolygon Ecosystem Token\nFilecoin\nCardano\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "Private key\nA private key is like a password \u2014 a string of letters and numbers \u2014 that allows you to access and manage your crypto funds.\nWhen you first buy cryptocurrency, you are issued two keys: a public key, which works like an email address (meaning you can safely share it with others, allowing you to send or receive funds), and a private key, which is typically a string of letters and numbers (and which is not to be shared with anyone). You can think of the private key as a password that unlocks the virtual vault that holds your money. As long as you \u2014 and only you \u2014 have access to your private key, your funds are safe and can be managed anywhere in the world with an internet connection.\nThe system of public and private keys are one of the cryptographic innovations that make digital money possible and secure. Here is how they work.\nCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized \u2014 meaning there is no bank or any other institution in the middle holding your digital money. Instead, your crypto is distributed across a network of computers via a technology called a blockchain. One feature of crypto blockchains is that they are open: all public key and transaction information is available for anyone to see.\nVia some complicated math, your public key is actually generated by your private key, which makes them a matched pair. When you make a transaction using your public key, you verify that it\u2019s really you by using your private key.  \nEven though everything is out in the open, it\u2019s also anonymous \u2014 you don\u2019t need to provide a name or address or any other information to use cryptocurrency. \nTake Bitcoin, for example. Even though any curious observer can see when Bitcoin is bought or sold or used, only the holder of a private key can make those transactions.\nLike any password, it\u2019s crucial to keep your private keys safe. The two major ways to keep track of them are: \nStore them online in a crypto wallet: The best and simplest option for most people is to use a virtual wallet, like the one offered by Coinbase, to manage your private keys. These are known as \u201chot\u201d wallets, because your private keys are stored on the internet. This makes buying, selling, or using your digital money as convenient and accessible as using a credit card online. Choose a wallet provided by a company with a long track record for security and features like two-factor authentication.\nStore them offline somewhere safe: Some investors choose to keep their private keys on a computer that isn\u2019t connected to the internet, written on pieces of paper, or even just memorized. This is referred to as \u201ccold storage,\u201d and while it does protect your private key against digital theft, it makes using your cryptocurrency much less convenient while creating other risks. \nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "Definitions\nTechnical analysis looks at patterns in market data to identify trends and predict how markets might move in the future. Fundamental analysis is a \u201cbig picture\u201d approach that examines financials, user community, and future real-world utility. \nThere are a lot of methods you can use to research an asset you\u2019re interested in trading. But two of the major strategies investors use are called technical analysis and fundamental analysis. \nTechnical analysis focuses on an asset\u2019s historical market performance: by examining price over time and trading volume over time, you can get a sense of how the market sees the asset. Is it rising or falling? Are people putting money in or taking it out? Is it traded widely and in large quantities? Those are the kinds of questions that technical analysis asks.  \nFundamental analysis, on the other hand, involves looking at an asset\u2019s \u201cfundamentals\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s more of a big-picture approach. It incorporates information like a cryptocurrency\u2019s financials, user community, and potential real-world applications. \nBoth are valuable ways of understanding an investment, and can be applied to everything from stocks and bonds to, of course, cryptocurrency. And they can both help you build a trading strategy and identify when you want to buy or sell a particular asset.\nWith fundamental analysis you can decide if an asset is overpriced or underpriced based on how you see its intrinsic value \u2014 as in, will it be more useful in the future? Take, for instance, Ethereum. Most decentralized-finance (or DeFi) applications run on its blockchain. If you assume DeFi will grow, you might guess that Ethereum\u2019s value will increase in the future.\nTechnical analysis is more of a numbers-driven approach to decision-making. It assumes that the market has already done the work of incorporating all the known information via the current price (which you can find in the Coinbase app or many other places online) and amount of trading activity (look to crypto-data sites like Nomics and CoinGecko).\nBecause current prices reflect market forces like supply and demand, practitioners of technical analysis believe that the price of an asset should give you a snapshot of how the public feels about it right now. This is known as market sentiment, and it\u2019s an indicator traders use to predict trends and make investment decisions.\nUnless you have access to high-level models and tools that pro traders use, using both strategies together can provide a fuller view of your trades. While fundamental analysis looks at the more objective indicators for an asset's potential long-term value \u2013 things like network activity, use case, business model, and roadmap \u2014 technical analysis focuses specifically on an asset\u2019s market performance. \nProfessional traders, on the other hand, might rely much more on one or other. (Large, mature markets tend to have lots of traders of both types.) A trader might, for instance, perform technical analysis using computer models that deeply examine changes in price and volume \u2013 including regressions, the relative strength index, and stock-market data. If a given asset tends to go through fairly regular boom-and-bust cycles, technical analysis can give investors insight into the rhythm of these cycles, helping them see opportunities to capitalize on these short-term cycles. \nExecuting successful short-term investment strategies is notoriously difficult. History doesn\u2019t repeat itself, so studying price patterns won\u2019t necessarily help you make strong predictions, especially in volatile markets. \nYou should invest only what you can afford.

    "text": "Definition\nVolatility is a measure of how much the price of an asset has moved up or down over time. Generally, the more volatile an asset is, the riskier it\u2019s considered to be as an investment \u2014 and the more potential it has to offer either higher returns or higher losses over shorter periods of time than comparatively less volatile assets.\nVolatility is a measure of how much the price of any particular asset has moved up or down over time. Generally, the more volatile an asset is, the riskier it\u2019s considered to be as an investment \u2014 and the more potential it has to offer either higher returns or higher losses over shorter periods of time than comparatively less volatile assets. \n As a newer asset class, crypto is widely considered to be volatile \u2014 with the potential for significant upward and downward movements over shorter time periods. Stocks are considered to have a wide range of volatility, from the relative stability of large-cap stocks (like Apple or Berkshire Hathaway) to often erratic \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d Bonds, by contrast, are considered to be a lower-volatility asset \u2014 and typically see less dramatic upward and downward swings that take place over longer time frames.\nWhen people talk about measuring volatility, they\u2019re usually referring to \u201chistorical volatility,\u201d a number derived from a study of prices over a specific time period (often 30 days or a year). The prediction of future movements is called \u201cimplied volatility\u201d \u2014 and because nobody can actually predict the future it\u2019s a less exact science (although it\u2019s the basis for widely used financial tools like the Cboe Volatility Index, nicknamed the \u201cfear index,\u201d which predicts the next 30 days\u2019 stock market volatility).   Quantifying volatility can be done a couple of ways: \nYou can use a method called beta, which measures how volatile one stock is relative to the broader market (the typical benchmark is the S&P 500). \n You can compute an asset\u2019s standard deviation, which is a measure of how widely its price has diverged from its historical average.\nVolatility is one of the primary factors that goes into assessing investment risk. Traditionally, investors will take on a high level of risk if they believe the potential reward is worth the possibility of losing some of their investment. (Or all of their investment, as in the recent case of high-risk hedge-fund manager Bill Hwang, whose entire $20 billion dollar fund disappeared in two days.) \nTraditionally, retail investors are advised to diversify their investments within an asset class as a way of reducing risk. One popular strategy is to invest in a basket of stocks (or an index fund), rather than just a few. To further reduce the potential for downside, they may also pair investments in more volatile asset classes like stocks with investments in less volatile classes like bonds. \nAs an asset class that\u2019s only a little more than a decade old, crypto has seen a series of steep rises and subsequent falls \u2014 and is considered to be more volatile as a category than stocks. That said, higher trading volumes on Bitcoin (by far the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap) and increased institutional participation seem to be reducing its volatility over time. Cryptocurrencies with lower trading volumes or emerging cryptoassets like DeFi tokens tend to have higher volatility \u2014 when experimenting with these assets as a beginner it\u2019s best to risk amounts you can afford to lose. \nFactors that can increase volatility include positive or negative news coverage and earnings reports that are better or worse than expected. Unusually high spikes in volume of trading will usually correspond to volatility. Very low volume (as seen with so-called penny stocks that don\u2019t trade on major markets or smaller cryptocurrencies) also usually corresponds with high volatility.\nFor some crypto investors, high volatility is part of the appeal \u2014 it creates the possibility for high returns. (And even as Bitcoin\u2019s volatility seems to be declining, it often moves by double-digit percentages in a single week, allowing for strategies like \u201cbuying the dip.\u201d) \nFor less risk-tolerant investors, there are strategies that can be used to limit the downside impact of volatility, like dollar-cost averaging. (Generally, investors with longer-term strategies who have good reason to believe that an investment will ultimately rise over time don\u2019t need to think as much about short-term volatility.)  And there are now cryptocurrencies specifically designed to have low volatility called stablecoins (including USD Coin and Dai) \u2014 these have their price pegged to a reserve asset like the U.S. dollar.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "A beginner's guide to the popular decentralized exchange (or DEX) on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users anywhere in the world to trade crypto without an intermediary.\nDefinition\nUniswap is the largest decentralized exchange (or DEX) operating on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users anywhere in the world to trade crypto without an intermediary. UNI, the governance token that allows users to vote on key protocol changes, is the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap on Coinbase as of April 2021 \u2014 with a total value of more than $18 billion.\nUniswap was one of the first decentralized finance (or DeFi) applications to gain significant traction on Ethereum \u2014 launching in November 2018. Since then, numerous other decentralized exchanges have launched (including Curve, SushiSwap, and Balancer), but Uniswap is currently the most popular by a significant margin. As of April 2021, Uniswap had processed over $10 billion in weekly trading volume.\nUniswap pioneered the Automated Market Maker model, in which users supply Ethereum tokens to Uniswap \u201cliquidity pools\u201d and algorithms set market prices (as opposed to order books, which match bids and asks on a centralized exchange like Coinbase) based on supply and demand.\nBy supplying tokens to Uniswap liquidity pools, users can earn rewards while enabling peer-to-peer trading. Anyone, anywhere, can supply tokens to liquidity pools, trade tokens, or even create and list their own tokens (using Ethereum\u2019s ERC-20 protocol). There are currently hundreds of tokens available on Uniswap, and some of the most popular trading pairs are stablecoins like USDC and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).\nSome of the potential advantages of decentralized exchanges like Uniswap include:\nSafe: Funds are never transferred to any third party or generally subject to counterparty risk (i.e. trusting your assets with a custodian) because both parties are trading directly from their own wallets.\nGlobal and permissionless: There is no concept of borders, or restrictions on who can trade. Anyone with a smartphone and an internet connection can participate.\nEase of use and pseudonymous: No account signup or personal details are required.\nIn order to use Uniswap, all you need is an Ethereum wallet, such as Coinbase Wallet, and a bit of ETH (which you\u2019ll need to pay for gas fees). Using the app browser built into Coinbase Wallet's mobile application or its desktop browser extension, you can access app.uniswap.org to start swapping tokens or supplying liquidity. \nOne issue users of all Ethereum-based apps including Uniswap face are transaction fees (also called gas) that can vary widely in price and can make it expensive to use the network. Multiple solutions to this issue are in the works, from the long-planned transition to the ETH2 blockchain (scheduled for sometime in 2022) to the nearer-term rollout of a \u201cLayer 2\u201d scaling solution called Optimism later this year. Uniswap developers are confident that Optimism will allow for significantly cheaper Uniswap transactions.\nIn early May 2021, Uniswap v3 launched with the goal of making transactions faster and cheaper.\nAfter years of successful operation and on its path to complete decentralization, Uniswap introduced the UNI token to enable community ownership over the protocol, allowing stakeholders to vote on key protocol changes and development initiatives. When Uniswap released the token in September 2020, it used a unique form of distribution in which it \u201cairdropped\u201d 400 UNI tokens to each Ethereum address that had ever used the protocol. Over 250,000 Ethereum addresses received the airdrop, which was worth nearly $1,400 at the time. Airdrops have since become a popular way for DeFi apps to reward longtime users \u2013 Uniswap has said it plans to distribute a total of 1 billion UNI over four years. \nIt\u2019s because Uniswap, like most crypto protocols, is open source, meaning anyone can both see exactly how it works and adapt the code to create a competitor. \nIn recent years, a large number of DEXs adapted from Uniswap\u2019s code have launched, including food-named competitors like SushiSwap and PancakeSwap.

The hash rate serves as a performance indicator for specialized mining machines, showing the rate at which a mining hardware processes data in its quest to compute a valid block hash.\nIn the context of Bitcoin and other digital assets, the hash rate is associated with the potential compensation of a miner or mining pool. A higher hash rate corresponds to a greater likelihood of successfully mining a block, thereby increasing the miner's chances of being compensated for processing transactions.\nA blockchain network typically uses a special mathematical function known as the hash algorithm to randomly produce a hash value. Miners on the network compete to generate the correct hash. The winning miner is then allowed to validate transactions and is compensated for solving the mathematical puzzle.\nHowever, generating a valid hash can take millions of guesses. The number of guesses made per second is computed as the hash rate. High hash rates mean that the network has many competing miners, which generally indicates that a network is secure and efficient.\nHash rates measure the number of computations a network can perform per second. A blockchain network\u2019s combined hash rate is estimated as the sum of the total hash rates of all the mining hardware in the network.\nHash rates are calculated in terms of hashes (guesses) per second (h/s). They can be represented in notations such as kilo (KH/s), mega (MH/s), giga (GH/s), tera (TH/s), peta (PH/s), and exa (EH/s).\nThe hash rate is an important metric for assessing the strength of a blockchain network \u2013 more specifically, its security. The more machines dedicated by honest miners to discovering the next block, the higher the hash rate rises and the harder it becomes for malicious agents to disrupt the network.\nA high hash rate is associated with the robustness of a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain network, as there is less of a chance of an attack on the network. The more miners who are part of a blockchain network competing to mine blocks, the less likely it is for a malicious attack on the network to occur.\nThe history of Bitcoin's hash rate growth is a testament to the evolution of mining technology. Since its early days, the hash rate of the Bitcoin network has experienced a surge, catalyzed by the development of specialized mining hardware known as ASIC miners. As of the last available data in October 2021, the Bitcoin network operates at a hash rate of roughly 150,000,000 TH/s, indicating the scale of the network's computational power.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

It provides a set of guidelines for creating unique tokens that represent digital assets. These tokens are non-fungible, meaning that they cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis due to their unique properties. The significance of ERC-721 lies in its potential to facilitate the creation of NFTs, which have a wide range of applications in gaming, art, collectibles, and more.\nThe ERC-721 standard consists of a set of functions that developers can implement in their smart contracts to create, transfer, and manage NFTs. These functions allow for the creation of unique tokens with their own metadata, making them distinguishable from one another. Under the hood, ERC-721 smart contracts maintain a record of token ownership, allowing for the transfer of tokens between users. The contract also keeps track of the total supply of tokens and the balance of tokens owned by individual addresses.\nThe ERC-721 token standard has several features for unique digital assets in the form of NFTs. It allows users to have, transfer, and manage unique digital assets. The ERC-721 token standard has been used in the context of digital art, where artists can create unique pieces of art as NFTs, providing them with a new avenue for their work. The ERC-721 token standard is used in the gaming industry, where game developers can create unique in-game items as NFTs.\nThe initial ERC-721 specification was proposed by Dieter Shirley as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP), which is a process for introducing new standards to Ethereum. The official authors of the ERC-721 standard are William Entriken, Dieter Shirley, Jacob Evans, and Nastassia Sachs. It's important to note that anyone can submit an EIP, but it goes through a process of review and revision before it is accepted by the community.\nOne of the most widespread uses of the ERC-721 token standard is for digital art. Publishing art, or any type of media, on the blockchain means that it can be exchanged and transferred via the underlying blockchain network. NFTs are transforming a number of other industries, by allowing individuals to have a stake in their digital landscape.

It is a crucial component of Ethereum's infrastructure, enabling the execution of code exactly as intended. EVM is not a physical machine but a virtual one, operating across thousands of computers, or nodes, participating in the Ethereum network. This distributed nature of EVM ensures the security and reliability of the Ethereum network.\nThe EVM operates as a state machine, meaning it computes a new valid state from block to block based on a set of predefined rules. These rules govern the execution of smart contracts and the updating of the Ethereum blockchain's state. When a smart contract is executed, the EVM interprets the contract's code, which is written in a language called Solidity and then converted into bytecode. The EVM uses this bytecode to perform specific tasks, ensuring that the contract's code is executed exactly as written.\nThe EVM is instrumental in maintaining consensus across the Ethereum blockchain. Every node in the Ethereum network runs the EVM, ensuring that all nodes agree on the state of the blockchain. This consensus is vital for the security and integrity of the Ethereum network. The EVM's ability to execute smart contracts enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps), which are applications that run on the blockchain rather than on a centralized server. This opens up a wide range of possibilities for developers and users alike, from decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to non-fungible tokens (NFTs).\nWhile the EVM is a core component of the Ethereum network, it is not exclusive to Ethereum. Many other blockchains, including Polygon, Arbitrum, and Avalanche, also use the EVM. This is because the EVM provides an environment for executing smart contracts, making it easier for developers to build applications that can run on multiple blockchains. This interoperability is a key advantage of the EVM and contributes to its widespread adoption.\nAs the blockchain space continues to evolve, the EVM is likely to play a role. Its ability to execute smart contracts and maintain consensus across the blockchain makes it a vital component of any blockchain that supports dApps. As more blockchains adopt the EVM, we can expect to see increased interoperability between different blockchains, opening up new possibilities for cross-chain applications and services.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

It maintains the latest record of transactions and ensures that all participants adhere to the network's rules. Nodes are components of a blockchain network, facilitating decentralized transactions. They aim to validate and process transactions without the need for a centralized entity, striving to ensure the integrity and security of the network.\nNodes work by maintaining a distributed ledger, known as a blockchain, that stores the complete history of transactions on a network. When a new group of transactions, or a block, is added to the blockchain, it is broadcast from node to node. This allows each node to update its own database in the same way, striving to ensure consistency across the network. Nodes aim to validate each other's transactions, striving to maintain a database of past transactions in a distributed manner.\nThere are various types of nodes, each with different roles within the blockchain network. For instance, miner nodes create and propose new blocks, while validator nodes aim to verify and approve new transactions. Some nodes, known as full nodes, store the entire history of a blockchain network, contributing to the network's security. The variety of node types is a characteristic of the blockchain network.\nSetting up a node involves downloading the blockchain's software onto a personal computer.

This connection is facilitated by a two-way peg, a mechanism that allows digital assets to be transferred between the parent blockchain and the sidechain.\nThe concept of sidechains was first introduced in an academic paper published in 2014 by a group of Bitcoin engineers. They proposed sidechains as a potential solution to some of the challenges faced by Bitcoin's infrastructure, such as scalability and decentralization trade-offs, and concerns about privacy and censorship.\nThe operation of sidechains involves several key components, including a two-way peg and smart contracts. The two-way peg is essential for facilitating the transfer of digital assets between blockchains. It allows digital assets to be locked on the mainnet and an equivalent amount to be unlocked on the sidechain, and vice versa.\nSmart contracts play a crucial role in validating and verifying the transfer of digital assets between the parent chain and the sidechain. They enforce honesty among the validators involved in the two-way pegged operation, minimizing the risk of fraudulent transfers or halted transactions.\nSidechains may contribute to improving the efficiency of the mainnet in several ways. They strive to tackle the issue of blockchain scalability by operating separately from the main blockchain, which may enhance the efficiency of the parent blockchain.\nSidechains may provide developers with different options than the main blockchain. They can experiment with different consensus protocols and blockchain features without affecting the operation of the mainnet.\nWhile sidechains may offer several benefits, they also come with potential drawbacks. One concern is the security of sidechains. Since they operate independently of the mainnet, they may not inherit the same level of security, making them potentially more vulnerable to attacks.\nAnother concern is the reliance on validators in the two-way pegged operation. If these validators do not act honestly, it could lead to fraudulent transfers or halted transactions.\nThere are several real-life examples of sidechains in use today. For instance, the Liquid Network and Rootstock are sidechains of Bitcoin, designed to enhance its scalability and functionality.

They were created by a blockchain analyst. The BRC-20 token standard supports the creation and transfer of fungible tokens via a protocol. This protocol allows data to be inscribed onto individual fractions of a Bitcoin.\nUnlike other token standards, the BRC-20 standard operates differently. It uses inscriptions to program fractions of a Bitcoin, creating unique tokens. These tokens are nonfungible, meaning each one is unique and has distinct attributes.\nThe BRC-20 token standard has several features that have been noted by users. One of the main features is its compatibility with the Bitcoin network. This compatibility allows Bitcoin tokens and BRC-20 tokens to integrate with the Bitcoin blockchain, capitalizing on the network\u2019s robustness and widespread acceptance.\nAnother feature of the BRC-20 standard is its simplicity. Unlike other token standards that rely on complex contracts, BRC-20 uses a simplified tokenization mechanism. This simplicity allows users to mint and transfer BRC-20 tokens without needing specialized technical expertise.\nFurthermore, the BRC-20 token standard aims to provide security. It leverages the inherent robustness of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is one of the many chains in the industry. By utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain, the BRC-20 standard can capitalize on these security mechanisms to maintain its functionality.\nWhile the BRC-20 token standard has many features, it's important to note that it is still experimental and users should exercise caution.

    "text": "Cloud mining is a method to mine cryptocurrencies by leasing equipment or renting computing power from data centers.\nIt offers a more accessible avenue to mining, eliminating hardware and operational challenges.\nHowever, cloud mining comes with its own set of risks, which can be mitigated with diligent research and decision-making.\nCloud mining is a process that allows individuals to participate in the mining of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, without needing to own or manage the mining hardware themselves. Instead, users provide compensation to rent mining capacities from a company that owns and manages the mining hardware and process. When the rented mining hardware mines a block, the rewards are shared among the users and the company. This method negates the process of individually setting up physical mining hardware, getting a high-speed internet connection, sourcing electricity, and maintaining the hardware.\nCloud mining works on the principle of pooled mining. Users acquire a certain amount of \"hash power\" from a mining farm, which is a remote server facility specialized in crypto mining. The provider gives them access to payouts in return that are based on the hashing power the miners have opted for. This enables individuals in remote regions with little to no physical infrastructure and limited technical skills to participate in the mining industry. The mining takes place \"in the cloud,\" rather than your personal computer.\nCloud mining relieves you of the financial burden of acquiring expensive equipment and maintaining it. You get to pass those costs on to the owner. By renting hash power from a mining farm, you receive a portion of the farm's overall returns without the costs. This makes mining accessible to a broader base of people because it reduces the need to acquire and maintain equipment or pay direct energy costs.\nOne of the downfalls of cryptocurrency is that because some command such a high price, scams have been reported. There is the prospect of diminishing returns because of increasing mining difficulty and more miners entering the networks to compete for earnings. This dominance promotes the centralization of cryptocurrencies, which were intended to be decentralized financial systems.\nThe cloud mining space has been rife with scams and fraudulent operations.

This concept was first introduced in a 1985 paper titled \"The knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems\" and has since been developed and improved for use in various applications.\nIn a ZKP, the prover strives to establish a claim, and the verifier is responsible for verifying the claim. The prover can demonstrate to the verifier that a statement is accurate without revealing any additional information regarding the statement. This is achieved by providing proof, or a small amount of information, that can be verified by the verifier to ensure that the statement is true.\nZero-knowledge proofs are a development in applied cryptography as they strive to enhance the security of information for individuals. For instance, consider how you might prove a claim (e.g., \"I am a citizen of X country\") to another party (e.g., a service provider). You'd typically need to provide \"evidence\" to back up your claim, such as a national passport or driver\u2019s license.\nHowever, this approach has its drawbacks, primarily the lack of privacy. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) shared with third-party services is stored in central databases, which are vulnerable to hacks. With identity theft becoming a critical issue, there are calls for more privacy-protecting means of sharing information, and this is where ZKPs could be utilized.\nAt a high level, a zero-knowledge proof works by having the verifier ask the prover to perform a series of actions that can only be performed accurately if the prover knows the underlying information. The prover and verifier interact in multiple rounds of the protocol, and in the conclusion, the verifier develops confidence in the veracity of the claim without learning any additional information about the secret.\nZero-knowledge proofs are being noticed in various fields, particularly in the area of blockchain technology. They allow for the verification of information without revealing the underlying data, aiming to provide a level of security and privacy. For instance, in the context of blockchain networks, the only information revealed on-chain by a ZKP is that some piece of hidden information is valid and known by the prover with a high degree of certainty.\nZero-knowledge proofs have certain drawbacks. These include hardware costs associated with the computational power needed to generate and verify proofs, proof verification costs, and trust assumptions.

It was first conceived by Daniel Larimer in 2013 and utilized in his project BitShares. In DPoS, users of the network vote in delegates, also known as validators, to verify and produce blocks. After they successfully produce a block, these validators may then distribute their block rewards to those who voted for them.\nDPoS intends to enhance the efficiency and democratic nature of block verification. It does this by allowing network users to vote and elect delegates who validate the next block. This democratic process is designed to address some of the limitations of the PoS system, such as the potential for centralization of power among those with the most tokens staked.\nIn a DPoS system, network users vote and elect delegates, who are also referred to as 'witnesses' or 'block producers'. Only a certain number of these delegates are permitted, and they can change, as others can be voted in instead.\nUsers of the network can pool tokens into a staking pool and vote for the particular delegate they wish. When staking, users of the network do not need to send their tokens to a particular wallet; instead, there is a staking mechanism or service provider they can operate through.\nDelegates play a crucial role in verifying the accuracy of transactions; and, if they validate the block correctly, they are then compensated with the transaction fees, which can be distributed to the individuals who voted them in. The more that a user is able to stake, the larger the allotment they can receive.\nLike any consensus mechanism, DPoS has its potential benefits and drawbacks. On the positive side, DPoS is designed for speed, scalability, and minimal hardware requirements. It also allows for voting power, which can make the process more democratic.\nHowever, DPoS also has its drawbacks. For one, it can potentially favor malicious token holders. It also requires constant engagement from users, which can be a barrier for some. Lastly, there is a potential lack of decentralization, as the system can favor those with the most tokens staked.\nSeveral projects employ DPoS in their blockchains. These projects have found that DPoS provides a democratic and efficient method for transaction validation and securing their networks.\nHowever, it's crucial to note that each project may implement DPoS differently, depending on their specific needs and goals. As such, the specific workings of DPoS can vary significantly between different blockchains. Despite these variations, the fundamental principle of DPoS remains the same: to provide a democratic and efficient way to reach consensus in a blockchain network.\nCompared to Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), DPoS is designed to provide a democratic and efficient method for transaction validation. While PoW requires significant computational power and energy consumption, and PoS can potentially favor those with the most tokens staked, DPoS aims to balance efficiency and fairness through its voting and delegation mechanism.\nHowever, like any consensus mechanism, DPoS is not without its challenges. It requires constant user engagement and can potentially favor those with the most tokens staked.

Besides the in-app tokens, content creators can develop their tokens, which they can use to receive compensation for their social interactions.\nBalancing incentives across all stakeholders is a key design principle of Web3 applications, which is made possible by the DAO model. SocialFi apps aim to take it one step further by using the concept of social tokens or in-app utility tokens. These tokens are not just at the application level but can be created at a user level. Creators can now manage their own economies through social tokens. Every user with meaningful brand equity can have their own token. The value of the token will be directly proportional to the social clout of the user.\nThe overarching aim of SocialFi is to create a more transparent, equitable, and user-centric digital social media landscape. However, to gain mass adoption, SocialFi platforms must overcome two major challenges - scalability and economic sustainability. Despite these challenges, the potential of SocialFi to disrupt the social media industry by sticking to Web3 ethos is immense. It is focused on solving key design issues around aspects of Web2 social media platforms as we know them today. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, the future of SocialFi is a topic of interest.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "Impermanent loss is a risk that occurs when participating in DeFi liquidity pools, where the value of your allocated assets changes from the time you allocated them.\nThis loss is termed 'impermanent' because it can be mitigated if the token price returns to its original value.\nWhile impermanent loss presents risks, providing liquidity also provides rewards through trading fees and additional tokens.\nImpermanent loss refers to a situation where the compensation you receive from allocating a token in a liquidity pool is less than what you would have received just holding the asset. This happens when a token\u2019s price changes in the market, causing your allocated assets in the liquidity pool to become worth less than their present value in the market. The larger this price change, the more your assets are exposed to impermanent loss.\nFor instance, if the value of the assets in the pool changes significantly, the user may experience impermanent loss. This gap is \u201cimpermanent\u201d because it is possible to close the gap if the token price returns to the former price.\nImpermanent loss does not necessarily prevent liquidity providers from receiving compensation. This loss is only tangible if investors withdraw their liquidity from the pool at that exact moment in time. Often, pools employ strategies to offset this loss, such as charging high fees. Therefore, liquidity providers receive more from fees to cover their impermanent loss.\nHowever, in case of a considerable price difference, your fee compensation might not cover the loss. In this case, you would have gained more value if you held the assets instead of providing liquidity.\nCalculating your exact loss might be a little tricky due to the complexity of some of its variables. But you can estimate your loss with the formula below:\nImpermanent Loss = 2 * sqrt(price_ratio) / (1+price_ratio) \u2013 1\nThe price ratio is the ratio between the token price at allocation and withdrawal.\nWhile you can\u2019t avoid impermanent loss, you can reduce exposure. Here are some tips to help:\nThe more volatile the assets, the more impermanent loss is likely to occur. Use more stable tokens like stablecoins or BTC to reduce the chance of impermanent loss.\nEnsure you also use tried and tested Automated Market Makers to reduce your exposure to market manipulation.\nStart by allocating a small amount to diversify your portfolio and reduce the percentage of your assets exposed to impermanent loss.\nImpermanent Loss Protection (ILP) is a type of insurance that protects liquidity providers from unexpected losses. Liquidity provisioning is only beneficial on typical AMMs if the benefits of farming surpass the cost of temporary loss. However, if the liquidity providers suffer losses, they can utilize ILP to protect themselves against impermanent loss. To activate ILP, tokens must be allocated on a farm.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "Real-World Assets (RWAs) are tangible assets that exist outside the digital spectrum, which can be tokenized and brought into the blockchain ecosystem.\nTokenization of RWAs aims to enhance liquidity, transparency, and accessibility, enabling a broader range of individuals to engage with high-value assets.\nDespite the potential benefits, tokenization of RWAs also presents challenges such as regulatory considerations and security issues.\nReal-World Assets (RWAs) refer to tangible assets that exist outside the digital realm. These can range from bonds to real estate properties, commodities, and machinery. The concept of RWAs in the blockchain context is about digital tokens that represent these physical and traditional financial assets. This includes currencies, commodities, equities, and bonds. The tokenization of RWAs is seen as one of the largest market opportunities in the blockchain industry, with a potential market size in the hundreds of trillions of dollars.\nTokenization is the process of converting real-world assets into digital tokens through blockchain technology. This process aims to enable fractional ownership and make high-value assets more accessible to a wider variety of individuals by facilitating the division of assets into smaller, more affordable units. Tokenized real-world assets, such as real estate, art, commodities, and even intellectual property, strive to offer greater liquidity, transparency, and accessibility. This digitization of physical assets is often seen as a way to modernize and democratize conventional financial markets.\nTokenizing real-world assets brings several benefits. Enhanced liquidity is one of the most significant advantages. Unlike traditional markets with set trading hours, the nature of blockchain technology allows for continuous engagement with these tokens, providing individuals with more flexibility. Moreover, the transparency built into blockchain technology increases investor confidence, further reducing the possibility of fraud and ownership conflicts. Tokenization also aims to lower the costs associated with asset management, such as paperwork, intermediaries, and legal fees, by removing many of the entry barriers prevalent in traditional financial markets.\nDespite the potential benefits, tokenization of RWAs also presents challenges. Regulatory considerations that differ by jurisdiction are a significant concern. Any tokenization project must adhere to local laws and regulations. Security is another crucial issue due to the vulnerability of digital assets to fraud and hacking. Effective custody solutions and security measures are required to preserve these assets.\nRWAs find a place within the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem, increasing the availability of these often inaccessible financial tools and opening up new horizons of applications. The tokenization of RWAs may contribute to the broader acceptance of the crypto industry. With the potential to influence global economies, the opportunity exists. Its acceptance in traditional finance is ongoing.

It sits at the intersection of NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi), with the intention to unlock additional value, opportunity, and liquidity for the NFT market.\nNFTFi is still nascent, and there is potential for building innovative models for unlocking additional NFT utility. At its core, NFTFi seeks to provide decentralized financial services for NFT market participants.\nNFTFi protocols provide DeFi functionality to NFTs\u2014unlocking the ability to rent, borrow, and fractionalize NFTs, create derivative and prediction markets around them, and more.\nFor instance, NFTFi lending and borrowing protocols enable NFT holders to lock up their digital assets as collateral to unlock liquidity in another digital asset. An NFT owner locks up their NFT with a protocol, borrows fungible digital assets by compensating lenders over time, with the NFT acting as collateral in case the NFT owner defaults on their loan. The NFT owner can repay their loan to receive back their NFT at any time.\nNFTFi has several applications that provide opportunities for users.\nOne of the applications is NFT lending and borrowing. Similar to DeFi money markets, NFTFi lending and borrowing protocols enable NFT holders to lock up their digital assets as collateral to unlock liquidity in another digital asset.\nAnother application is NFT fractionalization, which is the process of locking up an NFT and then minting fungible tokens that\u2014as a whole\u2014represent the underlying NFT. This provides benefits to both NFT owners and prospective buyers.\nNFTFi provides several benefits, including the ability to unlock liquidity from NFTs without necessarily having to sell the NFT itself.\nIt also provides novel forms of compensation for lenders and encourages better price discovery, as fungible tokens are more liquid than their non-fungible counterparts.\nHowever, NFTFi also faces challenges such as low liquidity, high price volatility, and significant transaction costs and delays associated with blockchain transactions.\nDespite these challenges, NFTFi continues to develop and evolve, providing opportunities for innovation in the cryptocurrency space.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "Sandwich attacks are a form of market manipulation on decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\nThese attacks exploit the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology to the attacker's advantage.\nUnderstanding sandwich attacks can help users protect themselves and make more informed decisions in the crypto space.\nA sandwich attack is a strategic exploitation of a transaction initiated by a user on a decentralized exchange. The attacker places one order right before the user's transaction and one right after it, effectively \"sandwiching\" the user's transaction.\nThis form of market manipulation leverages the fundamental principles of blockchain technology, such as transparency and immutability, to the attacker's advantage, often at the expense of regular users.\nIn a sandwich attack, a malicious trader identifies a pending transaction on the network, for example, Ethereum. The attacker then places an order before the user's transaction (front-running) and another one right after it (back-running). The intention is to influence the price of the cryptocurrency being traded, which could potentially benefit the attacker.\nFor instance, the front-run order might drive up the price of the cryptocurrency, causing the user to pay more. The back-run order could then be used to sell the cryptocurrency, potentially causing the price to drop and leaving the user with a less valuable asset.\nSandwich attacks may have consequences for users and the broader crypto market.\nFor the individual user, a sandwich attack can result in financial loss as they may end up paying more for a cryptocurrency than its actual market value. On a larger scale, these attacks can contribute to price volatility and undermine trust in decentralized exchanges.\nThere are several strategies users can employ to protect themselves against sandwich attacks.\nOne approach is to use a higher gas price for transactions, as this can make it more expensive for an attacker to front-run or back-run the user's transaction.\nAnother strategy is to avoid making large trades that could attract the attention of attackers.\nUsers may also consider using technologies or platforms that aim to obscure transaction details, making it harder for attackers to identify potential targets.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "ERC-20 is a technical standard for establishing fungible assets on the Ethereum blockchain.\nIt provides a set of rules that ensure assets function properly within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nERC-20 assets can symbolize various digital assets and are utilized in a wide range of applications.\nERC-20, or Ethereum Request for Comment 20, is a technical standard used for issuing and implementing assets on the Ethereum blockchain. It was proposed in 2015 by Ethereum developer Fabian Vogelsteller. The standard outlines a common set of rules that an asset must follow to function correctly within the Ethereum ecosystem. These rules pertain to how ERC-20 assets are transferred within the Ethereum blockchain and how their supply and address balances are consistently recorded.\nThe primary purpose of the ERC-20 standard is to ensure interoperability between different assets and applications on the Ethereum blockchain. This interoperability makes it easier for developers to predict how different assets will interact with each other and with various applications. ERC-20 assets can be used to symbolize a wide range of digital assets or tradable goods, such as digital tokens, vouchers, gold certificates, loyalty points, and IOUs. They can also be used to tokenize voting rights during elections.\nThe introduction of the ERC-20 standard has influenced the Ethereum ecosystem. It has simplified the process of establishing and issuing a digital asset, leading to a surge in interest in ICO crowdfunding events and blockchain technology as a whole. As of now, there are more than 350,000 ERC-20 assets on Ethereum, including well-known assets like Tether (USDT), Binance USD (BUSD), Polygon (MATIC), and Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB).\nERC-20 assets are the utility assets of the Ethereum blockchain. They each have unique functions and are designed for different purposes within the ecosystem. ERC-20 assets can be stored in most ETH wallets and sent to any Ethereum wallet address. They symbolize association with any fungible asset and are established on the Ethereum Network using smart contracts.\nThe future of ERC-20 is anticipated to continue contributing to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. The standard has empowered developers to build on Ethereum, facilitating a network effect that has resulted in the emergence of numerous new assets. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to evolve, the ERC-20 standard is likely to play a crucial role in its development.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.

    "text": "Definition\nTechnically, \u201ctoken\u201d is just another word for \u201ccryptocurrency\u201d or \u201ccryptoasset.\u201d But increasingly it has taken on a couple of more specific meanings depending on context. The first is to describe all cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin and Ethereum (even though they are technically also tokens). The second is to describe certain digital assets that run on top of another cryptocurrencies\u2019 blockchain, as many decentralized finance (or DeFi) tokens do. Tokens have a huge range of potential functions, from helping make decentralized exchanges possible to selling rare items in video games. But they can all be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency.\n\u201cToken\u201d is a word that you hear a lot in cryptocurrency. In fact, you might hear Bitcoin described as a \u201ccrypto token\u201d or something similar, because \u2014 technically \u2014 all cryptoassets can also be described as tokens. But the word has increasingly taken on two specific meanings that are common enough that there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll encounter them. \nA \u201ctoken\u201d often refers to any cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin and Ethereum (even though they are also technically tokens). Because Bitcoin and Ethereum are by far the biggest two cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s useful to have a word to describe the universe of other coins. (Another word you might hear with virtually the same meaning is \u201caltcoin.\u201d)\nThe other increasingly common meaning for \u201ctoken\u201d has an even more specific connotation, which is to describe cryptoassets that run on top of another cryptocurrency\u2019s blockchain. You\u2019ll encounter this usage if you become interested in decentralized finance (or DeFi). While a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has its own dedicated blockchain, DeFi tokens like Chainlink and Aave run on top of, or leverage, an existing blockchain, most commonly Ethereum\u2019s. \nTokens in this second category help decentralized applications to do everything from automate interest rates to sell virtual real estate. But they can also be held or traded like any other cryptocurrency.\nGiven that you\u2019ll come across the word a lot while researching cryptocurrencies, it\u2019s useful to understand some common connotations. But besides the big-picture definitions in the section above, there are also some categories of cryptoassets that actually have \u201ctoken\u201d in their name. Here are a few examples of those:\nDeFi tokens A new world of cryptocurrency-based protocols that aim to reproduce traditional financial-system functions (lending and saving, insurance, trading) has emerged in recent years. These protocols issue tokens that perform a wide variety of functions but can also be traded or held like any other cryptocurrency.\nGovernance tokens These are specialized DeFi tokens that give holders a say in the future of a protocol or app, which (being decentralized) don\u2019t have boards of directors or any other central authority. The popular savings protocol Compound, for example, issues all users a token called COMP. This token gives holders a vote in how Compound is upgraded. The more COMP tokens you have, the more votes you get.\nNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)  NFTs represent ownership rights to a unique digital or real-world asset. They can be used to make it more difficult for digital creations to be copied and shared (an issue anyone who has ever visited a Torrent site full of the latest movies and video games understands). They\u2019ve also been used to issue a limited number of digital artworks or sell unique virtual assets like rare items in a video game. \nSecurity tokens Security tokens are a new class of assets that aim to be the crypto equivalent of traditional securities like stocks and bonds. Their main use case is to sell shares in a company (very much like the shares or fractional shares sold via conventional markets) or other enterprises (for instance, real estate) without the need for a broker. Major companies and startups have been reported to be investigating security tokens as a potential alternative to other methods of fundraising.\nA selection of cryptocurrencies in the top 50 by market cap.\nStellar Lumens\nNEAR Protocol\nOFFICIAL TRUMP\nBonk\nSolana\nChainlink\nRender (ERC-20)\nAvalanche\nInternet Computer\nRender\nFilecoin\nCardano\nWe're the most trusted place for people and businesses to buy, sell, and manage crypto.\nGet started\nUnited States\nEnglish\nWe use cookies and similar technologies on our websites to enhance and tailor your experience, analyze our traffic, and for security and marketing.
